## Chapter 1
# Introduction
}}

Deep beneath the sands of Antarriah's largest desert, ancient secrets wait to be uncovered. A wizard who arrived from another world is frantically trying to access an abandoned, forgotten ruin of a civilization much more advanced than any society of the present day. An upcoming threat of doom is looming over Antarriah if he can harness the power that lies hidden for millennia, either as a consequence of his recklessness or at his order.

### Document Structure
The **Shards of the Past** adventure book is divided into six major parts, each of which can be used independently or as part of a larger story arc.

#### Part 1 - Introduction
The first part of the book establishes the basic and additional rules for the campaign, as well as provides a description of the city of Sorsaler, which is the starting point of the campaign. In following chapters, it provides five additional short adventures, each of which takes place in the city.

These adventures are not necessary to run in pair with the campaign, but it is recommended to do so, as they provide opportunity to level up the characters before the main campaign, establish connection to the world and important figures in the city, and provide tone to the adventure.

#### Part 2 - Shards of the Past
The second part of the book describes the world most closely connected to the main purpose of this book: the Shards of the Past adventure path. This includes the villain, allies, goals, and locations present in the module, each with dedicated descriptions and encounters. As the party travels through Antarriah, they may stumble upon miscellaneous locations, and the Game Master should adjust the number of these to maintain a proper pace. 

Each location provided in this chapter is designed for the party to go through with several short rests and, in some cases, even a long rest. Therefore, the Game Master should be careful not to expend party resources too much before the plot-relevant encounters. The campaign had been designed for groups of four to five characters, as well as generous spread of magic items (some of which are provided by this module, and some possible to buy from various merchants, as described in **Appendix D**).

#### Appendix A - Character Options
The third part of the book provides a selection of additional backgrounds, which the players can use in character creation. Each of them helps to ground the character in the adventure, and provides minor bonuses as an incentive to the players to start their story as a hero native to Antarriah.

#### Appendix B - Bestiary
The fourth part of the book contains information on various creatures to be encountered during the adventure. The creatures in this appendix are not sorted alphabetically, by category or their challenge rating, but instead in order of their appearance in the adventure.

#### Appendix C - The Old Machines
The fifth part of the "Shards of the Past'' book provides stat-blocks and additional context on a subset of enemies of more modern descent. The Old Machines, as creations of the Precursors, may appear frequently in the adventure, and - as they are a rather crucial element of the campaign - it had been decided to separate them into their own appendix.

#### Appendix D - Magic Items
The final part of the book contains descriptions of magical items that the party may acquire during the adventure. This includes their properties, rarity, and cost, as well as any special rules for using them.

Additionally, in this appendix you'll find a list of items available from merchants, their baseline prices and optional rules for haggling.

### Running the Adventure
**Shards of the Past** is a module designed for a party of 4 to 5 adventurers starting at level six. It's intended to take them all the way to level seventeen using milestones leveling system. Encounters are designed to promote a diverse and flexible party, offering a challenge to both a generic group and highly specialized adventurers.

The adventure begins in the largest center of civilisation in the region, the **Free City of Sorsaler**. However, the document also contains a number of additional smaller adventures for levels two to five that allow the party to establish themselves in the city before embarking on the main plot. These quests are optional, but they can provide additional motivation to venture forth in search of the Precursors.

}}

*This document is meant for the Game Master's eyes only.* It's recommended that you at least skim the entire book before starting the campaign. However, it's possible to efficiently run the adventure by reading only a few pages ahead assuming you don't want to modify the linear structure. This book will not assume that you have any other materials aside from the *Standard Reference Document*, and will provide you with all things necessary to run the module as is. Descriptions and stat blocks for monsters and non-player characters (NPCs) are provided in the appendixes.

The adventure is presented in a linear fashion with a suggested turn of events. Encounters are balanced for a four to five character party. Every encounter with potentially hostile creatures is presented with suggested tactics the adversaries may employ, along with additional factors at play. However, remember that not every encounter listed as such has to start or end with a fight. Often, negotiation, deception or sneaking past the enemies is reasonable, and you should entertain your players' ideas.

### Story Overview
A group of adventurers, whether they are folk heroes or simple mercenaries, arrive at the Free City of Sorsaler on the eastern coast of Antarriah. They are hired to investigate the disappearances of Sorsaler's many scholars of history. As it turns out, **Alexander Grisseaux** is the person behind this. With the help of a mercenary company called The Forsaken Sons he is trying to access the fabled Lost Archives. The party follows their tracks.

\column

It turns out that **Grisseaux** had successfully ended his search for a relic, which he took away from the archives to use for an unknown purpose. The City Council hires the adventurers to follow after him, for whatever his intentions may be, the ancient device is a threat. The tracks lead to an old gnoll cave, where the party uncovers a buried complex containing an artificial intelligence that had been damaged by a mad wizard to tie up a loose end.
After a series of quests undertaken to gather parts to repair the AI, it is revealed that **Grisseaux** had ventured to the Forge of Guardians - a flying fortress left by the Precursors, capable of providing him with an immense army - but in turn opening up the material world to the nefarious reach of the Abyss. This soon leads to a confrontation between him and the party.

#### Adventure Structure
The adventure is presented in a linear fashion. However, as the party leaves the Free City, you, the Game Master, should provide them with encounters that are not directly tied to the main plotline. Consider the party's preferences and either utilize encounter tables or design your own smaller adventures.

There is a main storyline that involves revealing the secrets of a race known as 'the Ancients'. These Ancients built temples dedicated to their gods, the Precursors. The temples are constructed using materials and technology that are unfamiliar to the characters but recognizable to the players as modern or even futuristic. The clash with this technology can continue throughout the main plotline and exploration of the open world. However, in this book, it is limited to the main adventure.

# The Free City Of Sorsaler

### Magical Prohibition
The use of magic within the city premises is restricted, and the restriction is being enforced by the magic-inclined arm of the City Watch.

While some branches of magic, like creating undead, summoning demons or enchantments used to influence the free will of citizens are strictly forbidden, other - like healing - are allowed freely, though most spellcasters would require a license.

The mentioned license is of course given by the Mage Guild - and there are several tiers of magic using licenses, listed below:

##### Magical License
|License Name           |  Price | Spells Allowed          |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------------------|
|Registered Magic User  |   -    | Cantrips                |
|Common License         |   10gp | 1st to 3rd level spells |
|Battlemage's License   |  300gp | 4st to 6rd level spells |
|Archmage's Permit      | 1000gp | 7st to 9rd level spells |

Every spellcaster that wishes to use magic has to register himself with the Magical Practices Bureau. While the registration itself is free of charge, and allows the mage to legally use cantrips within the city premises, it comes at a cost of privacy, as the records of all the registered mages are being kept.

There is no restriction towards the registration or releasing common spellcasting licenses (outside of the cost of the latter). Battlemage's License is only given to people without criminal record, and the Archmage's Permit - as described - requires personal evaluation by Praras, the Protector, which is tied to a long waiting time, although limited number of mages powerful enough to require such permit makes it a non-issue.

The City Watch is enforcing the magical prohibition by monitoring the use of magic within the city premises. Of course not all of its regions are being constantly patrolled, so the use of illicit magic does happen, especially in larger, private mansions, outside of prying eyes of the guards, and in the sewers, beyond the reach of most means of magical detection.

Illegal use of spells in the city premises is punishable by a fine, depending on the intention of the given spellcaster, the type of spell used, damages done, and the criminal record of the given individual.

### Goods and Services
:
There are many inns and workshops throughout the city, though not all of them would attract an adventurer. The list of the establishments provided in the table Services in Sorsaler City is not a complete register, but rather an enumeration of the most reputable, important, and popular places.

The price category listed should reflect on the base price of the items, while an Insight bonus of the shopkeeper is listed for the purpose of haggling *(see Appendix D - Magic Items)*.

As for the goods available - the Pearl of the East has access to an impressive supply chain, and every item listed in Chapter 3 is available to be bought or sold. Magical items with a value of 10 000 gold pieces may take 1d4 days to procure, while lesser can be found in less than a day.

### Employment
As a result of its status as the largest city in the region, Sorsaler attracts a diverse range of individuals, including adventurers, mercenaries, merchants, thugs, and thieves. Thus, it can be inferred that there is no shortage of employment opportunities available.

Nevertheless, it would be incorrect to assume that mercenary work is simply offered to anyone who enters a tavern, nor are legitimate contracts typically awarded by enigmatic, cloaked figures lurking in the shadows. Instead, the majority of situations that necessitate the utilization of force, whether it be via magic or a sword, are overseen by one of the guilds or organizations located within the city.

#### Adventurer's Guild
The Guild offers a variety of contracts to mercenaries and hireable thugs, as well as critical services such as expedited weapon and armor repairs, albeit at a notably elevated cost. Due to its extensive network of associates, the Guild is capable of presenting adventurers with opportunities to procure wealth through both legal and illegal means, all while ensuring the utmost anonymity.

#### City Watch
The primary origin of bounties within the city limits is the City Watch. Although the compensation for completing these tasks is typically lower than what might be offered by other organizations operating within Sorsaler, working in collaboration with the city's authorities provides a certainty that the bounty is legitimate, as well as a guarantee that one will not be deprived of the agreed-upon reward. These contracts are consistently transparent, with payment always being issued in accordance with what was originally promised.

#### Mage Guild
The Mage Guild, an organization specializing in the arcane arts, works closely with the City Watch in addressing magical threats and more perilous creatures situated within the city and in its vicinity. Members of this organization are entitled to discounts on select magical services, as well as reduced pricing for spellcasting licenses. Nonetheless, membership in the guild necessitates the fulfillment of certain duties and the payment of semi-annual fees, intended to cover the maintenance of the organization.

Contracts provided by the Mage Guild have to do with investigating illegal uses of spells, and pursuing criminals who have employed magic in their crimes. The rewards are always great, but the Mage Guild doesn't take great care in warning their contractors about the dangers they are about to encounter.

\column

### The Circle of Eight
Originally established in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that shattered an ancient Warding Stone, which once safeguarded the material world against the emergence of large-scale, permanent gates into the Abyss - precipitating the onset of the Demon Wars - the Circle of Eight arose to fill the void left by the artifact's loss. Without the Warding Stone's powers, attributed to the long-lost race of the Ancient Ones, fighting against the demons proved to be nearly impossible without significant magical support. Many heroes emerged during this time of great turmoil, but it quickly became evident that the eight most powerful wizards were the most effective protectors of the world - eventually becoming the founders of the Circle. Despite their valiant efforts to push back the demonic tide, their endeavors proved fruitless, as the Abyss was an endless plane with an inexhaustible supply of soldiers to deploy.

After four years of relentless warfare, one of the archmages devised a plan to restore a natural barrier between the planes, which he persuaded the other powerful wizards to support. The precise means required to accomplish this feat remain unknown to anyone but the members of the Circle. Nevertheless, the barrier was ultimately reinstated.

The truth is that the Eight have found techno-arcane ruins of the Precursors, and have secretly used them to shield the world against otherworldly threats - but that story would not grant them much glory.

The amount of political power and influence that the archmages obtained following their triumph over the demonic horde was immense. Each of them was attracted to it for a variety of reasons, ranging from a simple desire for power to an appreciation of how this influence could bring about stability and safety, as well as serve as a counterweight to any potential tyrants seeking to ascend to power following the disastrous conflict.

#### Goals
It is commonly believed by the public that the Circle was formed with the intention of consolidating the power and influence of the archmages, who had earned their reputation and political clout by leading armies to victory during the Demon Wars. Opinions on whether such a small group should wield so much power over the world's affairs differ greatly, especially given that more than one of the archmages held a kingdom of their own. 

However, the true objective of the pact made by the archmages was to safeguard the world against the catastrophic consequences that would result if the seal that warded off the Abyss was broken.

\page

#### Archmage Praras
The chief wizard residing in the City is Praras the Protector, who currently holds the position of Archmaster of Abjuration. Despite his elderly age, he remains an active dwarf who prefers to avoid politics and often delegates tasks to mercenaries and adventurers, guiding them towards achieving his objectives. Praras attends most City Council meetings, but beyond that, he spends the majority of his time in his tower located at the center of the Temple Plaza.

### Criminal Problem
The organization commonly referred to as the Thieves' Guild has undergone a significant transformation from its origins as a loose association of small-time criminals engaging in petty theft and minor offenses. This change occurred when Augury and her criminal syndicate took control of the Guild.

For several years now, all thieves have been obligated to report exclusively to Augury, compelled to obey her, and required to pay their dues. Despite this coercion, many have found that the arrangement is not without its benefits. The association with the ruthless tiefling and her thugs provides a level of protection that goes a long way in avoiding imprisonment.

#### Structure of Power
In the Thieves' Guild, only one person's opinions hold sway — and that person is Augury. Her favored lieutenants do not possess any inherent authority; the influence they hold over other members is merely borrowed. Despite this, most criminals within the group are wary of them, as conducting business with Augury is a risky proposition: success resulting in a lucrative payday, and failure resulting in steep consequences.

### Hideouts
#### The Thieves' Guild Mansion
Located a day's travel away from the city proper, a large mansion has been funded using the guild's considerable coffers. It serves as a presentable venue where behind-the-scenes deals are struck with individuals who are not willing to be seen with criminals. Attendees include influential guards, wealthier craftsmen, mercenaries, and some even claim Council members attend these meetings.

The mansion, a spacious two-story villa, boasts multiple pools, a beautiful garden, and an orchard. Its interiors are elegant and opulently decorated, featuring silverware, crystal chandeliers, and expensive paintings framed in gold. Gilded flowers are a recurring theme throughout all the bedrooms.

\column
:
#### Ragnarok's End
Most of Augury's time is spent at the Ragnarok’s End Inn, situated in the northern docks and owned through a proxy. The bartender, a hulking tall red Dragonborn named Serk, is Augury’s trusted former lieutenant. He lost two fingers from his right hand, which has rendered him less effective in missions he used to perform. Nevertheless, Augury values his loyalty, and he now spends his time as a listener of rumors, spreading favorable ones to further Augury’s goals.

The inn has dim lighting, and the food is of mediocre quality at best, except for the wine collection reserved solely for the leader of the Thieves' Guild. The wooden floor is covered in oily dust, while the walls are adorned with tattered wallpapers displaying evident burn marks.

The usual clientele comprises mariners, mercenaries, and travelers who are unaware of the true purpose of this place as a front for a hideout. Additionally, there is a fair share of pirates seeking refuge during their stay in Sorsaler, attempting to avoid drawing too much attention. The Thieves' Guild allows their presence as long as they behave, pay upfront, and refrain from causing any trouble.

#### Tanner's Rest
Located near the Temple Square of the city, a tavern offers a higher standard than Ragnarok's End and attracts a diverse clientele, including both priests and adventurers.

The barmaid, a young and ever-smiling blonde named Alicia Hauptstadt, is always ready to share the latest gossip and connect customers with people who can help solve their problems. While her appearance is genuine, Alicia responds to Augury like any other member of the Thieves' Guild. This means that any information exchanged within the establishment is sure to reach Augury's ears sooner or later.

The large main hall is usually nearly full, with just a few tables unoccupied. At least one table is always reserved for someone of importance or particular interest to Augury. During festive evenings, not even a generous bribe would be enough to secure entrance. Alicia fully understands the value of an overheard secret.

Members of the Guild, those recognized by Alicia at least, can expect a fair discount on accommodation, food, and other discreet services. While safekeeping and fencing are the most commonly used services, rumors suggest that patrons can also make "special orders" with the barmaid. In simpler terms, Alicia can organize the smuggling of an item into or out of the city without alerting the authorities.

### Augury
The Thieves Guild is currently under the unquestioned leadership of Augury, a tiefling who was born into a humble family. Augury rapidly ascended through the ranks of the criminal underworld, and by her early twenties, most figures in the criminal world either feared or submitted to her.

Augury has a reputation for generously rewarding loyalty, but her ability to administer severe punishment for disobedience is even more widely recognized.

{{descriptive
One of the most infamous tales involving Augury recounts an incident with a moderately wealthy smith who dared to withhold the rightful payment for her 'wares'.

As the story goes, Augury burst into the smith's abode, seized him by his beard, and ruthlessly forced a grappling hook down his throat. Her ivory-hued stallion was then pressed into a horrific duty, hauling the hapless victim through the city's thoroughfares. A sinister mercenary priest rode in tandem, employing arcane arts to keep the wretched man alive during this grotesque punishment.

When the ordeal concluded, the smith's entrails were gruesomely exposed, but some grim accounts suggest that even amid his torment, his anguished pleas for mercy and screams of agony could still be heard.

Hush money silenced the guards, causing them to turn a blind eye to the grisly procession along her chosen route. Meanwhile, the denizens of the impoverished district, fully aware of the terror she could unleash, cowered in fearful silence, abstaining from reporting the harrowing incident to any authorities.
}}

Accompanying Augury wherever she goes is her familiar, a gray raven named Fate. The magical bond between the two is evident, allowing her to communicate with and direct the raven as needed. It is widely speculated that Augury employs Fate as a means of covertly spying on both her enemies and subordinates.

While she is renowned for her ruthlessness, Augury prefers to delegate tasks to her subordinates and mercenaries, as her time is far too valuable to be squandered on menial matters. This approach has proven effective, as it has been quite some time since any significant disciplinary actions were taken in her name.

\column
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

{{note
Augury is widely recognized throughout the city; respected by some, feared by many. Tales abound of the gruesome punishments she inflicts upon those who have dared to double-cross her.

In the concealed recesses of Sorsaler, where covert agreements take shape, shrouded figures maintain vigilance, their eyes trained on Fate, Augury's gray raven — a certain indicator that attentive ears are present.

## Chapter 3
# Haunted House
}}

### Quick Overview
An old, renowned smith had died recently, leaving a house haunted by ghosts and animated objects. The widow with their children had been rendered effectively homeless by the floating armors and swords, and sought to get rid of the dangers.

{{note
**Recommended level:** :: 2
:
**Expected enemies:** :: Constructs
:
**Reward:** :: 180 silver coins.
}}

This simple quest encompasses an adventuring's day worth of encounters, contained within a single mansion in the city.

### Obtaining the Quest
The most obvious way of obtaining the quest is visiting the local bureau of the Adventurer's Guild. The reward is listed as 180 silver coins, the address of the mansion is provided, but the information about the widow is not; the conditions for the contract are simple - to clear out all of the floors of the mansion.

The party might hear about the haunted house or the widow in need when visiting a tavern; after all, the events are certainly unusual, and would garner attention from the citizens. A **Charisma (Persuasion)** check will reveal additional information as per the table below:

| DC | Additional Information Gained|
|:------------------|:-----:|
| 10 | The widow has two children, and the smith passed less than a week ago. Supposedly, he committed suicide. |
| 15 | The haunted house is in the northern part of the city, near the North-Inner Gate. |
| 20 | The widow currently lives with her friend, **Eric Wittenburg**, three blocks away from her home.     |
| 25 | Smith's wife had been unfaithful to him, and some think that it's his ghost taking revenge on her. |

Some of these information will make it more or less difficult to find the spoken about widow, **Matilda Grelod**, and perhaps take the quest directly. If resolved without involving intermediaries, the reward might easily be raised by 20 silver coins, as she could forgo paying off the Guild's dues. If the party decides to do so, their standing with the Adventurer's Guild might suffer a hit, since the officials don't appreciate cutting them off a deal.

\column

### Encounters in the Mansion
The doors of the **Grelod Mansion** shut themselves upon entering. For **Flying Shields** use a **Flying Sword** stat-block, but it deals bludgeoning damage instead. **Flying Daggers** use d4 for damage dice.

#### Hall
The first room the party will see when entering through the main door doesn't contain many distinguishing features. A rather nice, wooden floor, a couple of doors, and a bit rugged, but probably still expensive despite its rough shape, rug. Above it, an iron chandelier is hanging on a rusty chain. There are a couple of armors by the doors.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Flying Sword** *(SRD, p.263)*
* 1x **Flying Shield**
* 1x **Animated Armor** *(SRD, p.263)*

##### Tactics:
The animated armaments will try to have a jump at the party, rushing towards the intruders immediately. *A passive Perception score of 15 negates the surprise.*

##### Environmental Dangers:
A large chandelier suspended above the floor can be destroyed to in turn fall down, dealing 4d6 piercing damage to all creatures below (halved on a successful **DC 12 Dexterity** saving throw.
}}

#### Library
This room contains several bookcases and a desk. The floor is covered with dust, and the windows are shut blind.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 3x **Swarm of Bats** *(SRD, p.389)*

##### Tactics:
The bats fly down from the ceiling, trying to surprise the party, however, when dealt enough damage to bring a particular swarm to half HP, this swarm will try to escape and wind a way out.

##### Environmental Dangers:
The room is dark and tight, providing limited space to fight off the animals.

#### Display Room
Inside of this room, there is a number of weapons, shields, and smaller pieces of armor like boots, gauntlets and even a breastplate on display, representing the works of **Johann Grelod**. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 2x **Flying Sword** *(SRD, p.263)*
* 2x **Flying Shield**

##### Tactics:
The animated objects are hanging on the walls, indistinguishable from normal weapons. The objects will attack once only one creature is inside the room, or either one of them is touched, surprising the party. *A passive Perception score of 15 negates the surprise.*

##### Environmental Dangers:
A small chandelier suspended above the floor can be destroyed to in turn fall down, dealing 2d6 piercing damage to all creatures below (halved on a successful **DC 13 Dexterity** saving throw.

##### Treasure:
Ten gold coins can be found in a false-bottom drawer in the desk, along with the **Will of Johann Grelod**
}}

#### Child Bedroom
A room on the second floor, clearly decorated for a child, with bright yellow walls, and drawings made with colored pencils depicting dragons, knights and monsters. A small bed is placed on the opposite side of the room than the window. In the center of the room, there is only a large rug, with a couple of children's toys lying around in disarray. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Smothering Rug** *(SRD, p.264)*

##### Tactics:
The rug will spring to life whenever the first creature finds itself within its range. *A passive Perception score of 15 negates the surprise, but not for the person stepping on the rug.*

##### Environmental Dangers:
As the room is on a higher floor, the rug might try to force someone down the window,  leading to falling damage.
}}
Closer investigation and a successful **DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana)** check can reveal that the rug was not magical - but animated by a lingering spirit.

\column

#### Dining Room
A medium-sized, but well-cleaned room features a dining table along with some chairs. There is some cutlery and plates prepared.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 2x **Animated Dagger**

##### Tactics:
The animated objects are lying on the table, indistinguishable from other cutlery present. The objects will attack once only one creature is inside the room, or either one of them is touched, surprising the party. *A passive Perception score of 15 negates the surprise.*
}}

#### Bedroom
This well-lit bedroom has brown walls and bedsheets. There is a nice set of armor standing in the corner, and a sword hanging above it.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Animated Armor** *(SRD, p.263)*
* 1x **Flying Sword** *(SRD, p.263)*

##### Tactics:
The objects animate and attack whenever the doors to this room are opened, not taking advantage of their indistinguishable nature.

##### Treasure:
Inside the locked chest near the bed, there is a stash of valuables: silver cutlery worth 1 gold piece, 15 silver coins and 36 coins. 
}}

#### Corridor
This room features a small niche on the side, inside of which an armor set on a stand is located. The wooden floor is covered with a long rug.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Animated Armor** *(SRD, p.263)*

##### Tactics:
The Animated Armor springs to action, cutting off the escape route, and targeting the more vulnerable characters.

##### Environmental Dangers:
The room is completely dark, and very narrow, making it difficult to move in a group.
}}

From there, the master bedroom is accessible by a set of double oaken doors with brass handles.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Master Bedroom
The largest room in the mansion is in a bad condition: broken furniture - most notably a wooden double-bed - is shattered. Amongst the rubble, the ghost of **Johann Grelod** awaits.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Echo** (**Johann Grelod**) *(SotP, p.159)*

##### Tactics:
Johann does not attack immediately, trying to intimidate the party into leaving his home.

##### Environmental Dangers:
The room is filled with broken furniture, and shattered floorboards, making the entire room a difficult terrain.

##### Treasure:
Near one of the broken drawers there is a key opening the doors to the mansion and a chest in one of the bedrooms.
}}

### Branching Paths
The party might decide to get rid of the ghost of the smith, and pick up their reward, before going on their merry way, however a conversation with him might provide some information that could otherwise be gathered by listening to gossip, or by reading the will of Johann Grelod.

His wife was, indeed, having an affair with **Eric Wittenburg** - a supposed  'friend', who is now accommodating the widow at his own home. **Johann**, feeling completely betrayed by a person he trusted, decided to write a will, to pass his ancestral home to his distant nephew, to punish his wife one last time before commiting suicide. He did not anticipate, however, that she would hide the will, bribing a con man to pretend to be a priest, and then try to sell the mansion - so he returned as a ghost to prevent it.

For bringing it up to the City Guard, and preventing the mansion going into his wife hands, **Johann** will offer up to reveal the location of his money stash, kept outside in fear of harsher times, containing a total worth of 25 gold pieces.

### Confronting the Widow
Returning to **Matilda** with the will of her husband will prompt her to raise the reward by an additional 100 silver pieces, if the party ignores the ghost, and clears the mansion anyway.

A successful **DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion)** check is enough to convince her to raise the reward to a total of 400 silver pieces.

She can be blackmailed with a **DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation)** check to do the same, but there is a risk that her friend will try to get physical. Causing any serious harm to either of them will result in the City Guard getting involved in the matter, and nullifying the reward, unless the mansion had been already completely cleared, and the Adventurer's Guild had been a broker in this quest.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Bandit Captain** (**Eric Wittenburg**) *(SRD, p.397)*
* 1x **Commoner** (**Matilda Grelod**) *(SRD, p.398)*

##### Tactics:
Matilda is cowardly, so when it comes to blows, she will surrender. Eric, however, will try to repel the attacks, but will drop weapons as soon as he realizes he is at disadvantage.
}}

Completing the quest by involving the clergy of Sorsaler will raise the party's reputation with the church, as faking the presence of a priest during funeral rites is a heinous deed, and revealing it is both serving the gods - and the purses of the priests, who don't offer their services freely.

## Chapter 4
# The Orc Gang
}}

### Quick Overview
In recent months, there had been a spike in criminal activity in one of the suburban districts of the town, notably a rise in crimes committed on and by drugged citizens. Supposedly, a goblinoid gang might be involved.

{{note
**Recommended level:** 3
:
**Expected Enemies:** Goblinoids, Beasts
:
**Reward:** 40 gold pieces
}}

### Obtaining the Quest
This quest can easily be obtained by checking the listings of the the Adventurer's Guild. Conditions are quite simple - localize and eliminate the gang members, one way or another - but permanently.

There are more groups that might take interest in the events, however. Simple rumors might bring the adventurers either to the Adventurer's Guild, or - if the party has proven to the criminal underworld that they are reliable - the Thieves' Guild, which has become concerned with new competitor.

**Augury** is willing to pay 20 gold pieces for a chest full of the supplies that the gang  has in its possession, double that if the party will either eliminate or subjugate them to her. If she is the one to propose the quest to the party, she will insist on resolving the matter quietly, as drawing too much attention from the City Watch, or Adventurer's Guild is highly undesirable in the business. Unless she had worked with the party members before, she will only offer the job through one of the members of the Thieves' Guild. If that's the first contact between them and the criminal world, one of the thieves might bump into one of the less alert party members, slipping a letter into their backpack or pocket.

### Encounters with the Thugs
The orc gang doesn't have too many henchmen, but careless sniffing around can provoke them to send some thugs. Fortunately for the party, they have a map to their hideout in a small cave not far away from the suburbs.

Possible ways of discovering the location are also drinking with goblinoid or orc population in the outer city districts, or simply trying to buy the drugs, and following the dealer.

\column

#### Thugs in an alleyway
When braving the streets of the city in poorer districts, or at night, a cry for help can be heard from a woman. Following it leads to a dark alleyway, where it becomes clear that it was just a ploy to lure the adventurers into a trap, where they can be conveniently dealt with by a group of goblins that belong to the gang.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Hobgoblin** *(SRD, p.322)*
* 3x **Goblin** *(SRD, p.266)*
* 3x **Wolf** *(SRD, p.329)*

##### Tactics:
The goblins are riding their wolf companions, making them very mobile and dangerous, being able to make immediate use of their pack tactics.

##### Environmental Hazards:
As the encounter is plainly on the streets of the city, the use of magic is restricted, unless the party has a license for spellcasting.
}}

#### On the Way
On their way to the cave in which the gang has their hideout, goblin scouts are ready to intercept the party, not far away from the outskirts of the city, outside of the safety of the city streets.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 3x **Goblin** *(SRD, p.266)*
* 3x **Giant Wolf Spider** *(SRD, p.381)*

##### Tactics:
The goblins are riding their spider companions, making them very mobile and dangerous, being able to make immediate use of their pack tactics.

##### Environmental Hazards:
If this scouting party knows to expect the adventurers, there might be a web or two pre-prepared on their way, for an additional advantage against the heroes.
}}
This scouting party carries with them orders to get rid of the 'pesky adventurers', who have taken interest in the gang activities.

#### Watchpost
The entrance to a small cave is guarded, and partially blocked off with wooden fortifications, atop of which a single sentinel is usually placed. Depending on the time of day, there may be some lights in the closest surroundings.
{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Bugbear** *(SRD, p.266)*
* 1x **Hobgoblin** *(SRD, p.322)*
* 4x **Goblin** *(SRD, p.266)*

##### Tactics:
These goblinoids try to guard the entrance to the cave first and foremost. If pressed hard enough, the Bugbear can use his action (only once) to howl into the trees nearby for 1d4 wolves to arrive.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The wooden fortifications in place provide a great source of cover for the goblins, who are able to fully cover themselves when prone, or easily hide.

##### Treasure:
The goblins near the cave entrance have a combined wealth of 48 copper coins at them.
}}

#### Main Chamber
The main chamber of the cave has a large, leathery tent near a fireplace, and several bedrolls around it.  Some wooden chests are placed around the vicinity.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Ogre** *(SRD, p.336)*
* 2x **Orc** *(SRD, p.308)*

##### Tactics:
Although scattered, the goblinoids will gather themselves quickly. The Orcs prefer to focus down fire on the enemy targeted by the Ogre in melee.

##### Environmental Hazards:
There is a bonfire in the center of the cave, which deals 1d6 fire damage, halved on a successful **DC 12 Dexterity** saving throw.

##### Treasure:
In a tent placed in the center of the cave, there is a chest containing an *Exquisite Longsword* (a non-magical variant of a *+1 Longsword*), coins worth 235 silver pieces total, small topaz worth 15 gold pieces and an accounting book. Near the walls of the cave there are three heavy chests, containing the unsold drugs.
}}


#### Bear Chamber
In a small chamber of the cave, a bit further from the entrance, there is a training spot for a brown bear, where the gang had been trying - with a modicum of success - to train a brown bear to fight.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Bugbear** *(SRD, p.266)*
* 1x **Brown Bear** *(SRD, p.369)*

##### Tactics:
The bear is trained to protect the Bugbear; the animal will try to knock prone, and then attack whomever is the closest enemy to its master.
}}


#### Troll Lair
At the far end of the cave, a fat troll had made his lair. He is well fed by the orcs of the gang, in exchange for loading the drugs onto carts, and unloading the money. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Troll** *(SRD, p.351)*

##### Tactics:
The troll is mostly concerned with putting off any sources of fire in his vicinity, and will immediately focus himself on any opponent using fire magic.

##### Treasure:
In the troll's lair, there is a chainmail preserved in a good enough condition to wear, as well as 30 silver coins.
}}

### Development
As it turns out, the entire operation, though executed by the orc of the Many Fangs tribe, is being run by a mysterious figure known as the **Queen of Thorns**, a mysterious, half-orc, would-be competitor to **Augury**. The accounting books kept in the main chamber of the cave reveals only that the most frequent client of the orc gang is a man who made quite a reputation for himself amongst the smugglers of the eastern Antarriah - a tabaxi known as **Icy Knot**.

#### Cowardly Smuggler
**Icy Knot** doesn't know the identity of the **Queen of Thorns**, but if threatened (with a successful **DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation)** or, if the words were supported with physical violence, a **DC 12 Strength (Intimidation)** check) will agree to lead the party to a place where he was to receive a large amount of drugs from her personally. (**Queen of Thorns** is using an Orc Warchief stat block, but has 120HP).

}}

### Resolution
Once the party has completed their mission of getting rid of the band, they will have the option to collect their reward from the Adventurer's Guild. However, in order to do so, they will need to provide proof of their success and submit a detailed report on their activities.

Additionally, the Adventurer's Guild may require a short period of investigation to ensure that the criminal activity of the gang has been fully eradicated from the districts in which they operated. This investigation may involve additional work for the party, such as gathering information and identifying any remaining members of the band.

#### The Blue Sand
The Thieves' Guild may become aware of the party's acquisition of the drugs if they were not contacted beforehand. In such a case, the Guild may make an offer of 20 gold pieces for the entire supply, which may seem low considering the drugs are worth three times that amount. However, given the highly illegal nature of possession, the offer may still be considered fair. It is up to the party to weigh the risks and benefits of accepting or declining the offer.

If the party declines the offer to sell the drugs to the Thieves' Guild, they should be prepared for potential consequences. The Guild will likely view the party as competition and attempt to steal the chest containing the drugs from wherever it's stored. The Game Master should determine the Guild's capabilities and the level of security the party has in place to prevent theft.

#### Queen of Thorns
If the players break a pre-made deal with Augury, the ruthless tiefling leader of the Thieves' Guild, she will not hesitate to send a group of assassins or thugs after them at an undisclosed time to kidnap and bring them to her for punishment. However, if the party has information about an ambitious half-orc who wishes to overthrow Augury as the new leader of the criminal underworld, she will be more than willing to pay handsomely for the tip. Revealing the guild's accounting books will double the reward. If the party has investigated and can provide specific information about the **Queen of Thorns**, **Augury** will raise the reward to 100 gold pieces.

If the Queen of Thorns has been killed or permanently eliminated by the party, Augury will reward them with an exquisite variant of studded leather armor or breastplate. It is important to note that Augury is the name of a highly respected and feared Thieves' Guild leader, and crossing her is not something to be taken lightly.

## Chapter 5
# The Dead Rise
}}

### Quick Overview
Since the beginning of this winter, the temple responsible for the city's cemetery had been targeted with series of crimes and unfortunate events, leading to lots of lost influence and wealth. Because of that, grave priests had to focus on maintaining the temple themselves, and - as it appears - have neglected their duties in keeping watch over the cemetery, which has attracted the attention of a necromancer. As the temple is worried about the necromantic taint, but as it has no battle priests or paladins in the city, and disclosing the situation to the temples of other gods would surely hurt its reputation, mercenaries are needed to get rid of the undead.

{{note
**Recommended level:** 4
:
**Expected Enemies:** Undead
:
**Reward:** 200 gold pieces
}}

### Obtaining the Quest
Of course the undead in the cemetery are an object of gossip in the city, but most of the people do not believe that they are creations of a necromancer, or even any larger group. Instead they tend to think that the undead are just disgruntled citizens, who cannot get rest over the inflation of the gold value in the city in recent years, or the tax policies of the Council, and so they return to un-life from that disturbance. This is obviously untrue to anyone with any knowledge of the undead, but the priests  have chosen to not enlighten the faithful in this matter, so as to not raise mass panic in the city.

If the group has made any kind of positive reputation for themselves in the city, a young priest, **Ansel Bracken** with a holy symbol hidden under a black robe will approach them, and ask to talk in a place that would grant them a bit of privacy. Otherwise, if they have no real reputation to speak of, but don't hide their proficiency in 'problem solving', the priest might find them anyways, if they have visited the temple, or the cemetery. If followed, **Ansel** will convey the wishes of the church for the party to investigate the matter, destroy the undead, and - if it is indeed the work of a necromancer - bring him to justice or execute. If they decide to do it immediately, he casts *Aid* at the party to help them.

\column

### Investigation
Confirming the presence of a necromancer should present little to no difficulty. Visiting the cemetery, and attempting to find any tracks presents the party - after a successful **DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)** check - with a quick way to find a group of skeletons digging near a grave, presenting an opportunity for a surprise. If the party had failed the check, they still find the tracks, but too late to catch the undead off guard.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Skeleton** *(SRD, p.346)*

##### Tactics:
The skeletons are not armed with any weapons, but each of them carries a shovel (*improvised melee weapon, +0 to hit, Hit: 1d4 slashing damage*).

##### Treasure:
One of the skeletons has a rusty, iron key on him. It opens the door to the mausoleum.
}}

Silently following the skeletons will quickly lead to a mausoleum, which the skeletons open, and carry the unburied body into.

Alternatively, a character proficient in Religion or Arcana should realize that raising the dead might require some material components,  and choose to ask around in alchemical shops. As it turns out, a mysterious figure in a black, tattered cloak does indeed visit some of the shops in search of the ingredients. One of the alchemists even saw the figure entering an abandoned house near the cemetery fence.

If the party would follow either of the leads, they will find the depths under the cemetery. If they have chosen to enter them through the cellar in the abandoned house, they will start in the Bone-Filled Room of the depths. Entering through the mausoleum leads to the Hidden Crypt.

### Encounters in the Depths
#### Bone-filled Room
This small room is lit by two torches. There is a hidden door, leading to a tunnel connecting it to one of the large family crypts from the nearby cemetery. A **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check is enough to reveal the scratches on the wall, where it opens up.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Skeleton** *(SRD, p.346)*
* 4x **Animated Bones** *(SotP, p.133)*

##### Tactics:
While the skeletons inside are plainly visible, the four Animated Bones rest amongst the forgotten remains, indistinguishable from the aged cadaver. They begin the initiative hidden.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The piles of bones in this room make for difficult terrain.
}}

The room is dimly lit by two torches on the wall, but the hidden entrance to the crypt is not lit by the flickering flames. The doors ahead are at the end of a 15 ft. long, 5 ft. wide corridor to the cluttered basement.

#### Hidden Crypt
After going through a short tunnel behind the door hidden in a wall, the opening leads to a chamber belonging to one of the ancestral burial places, located at a nearby cemetery. Undead presence can be easily felt in the air, as the smell of rotting flesh is unbearable. There is a large, stone door, locked with thick iron bars from the outside to detain the undead from going outside. If this place is entered from the side of the cemetery, a **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check will reveal the path deeper into this dungeon.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Ghoul** *(SRD, p.311)*
* 4x **Shadow** *(SRD, p.344)*

##### Tactics:
Shadows in this room come to life only at the beginning of their turn, giving off no indication of their unusual nature, unless searched for by magic, such as Divine Sense.

##### Treasure:
Inside the coffin, there is an *Exquisite Longsword*, along with a mundane shield, a dagger, and an amethyst worth 50gp.
}}

#### Cluttered crypt
This room is cluttered with broken coffins, rusted equipment and burned off torches. Animal droppings can be spotted in the entire area. The wooden door to the adjacent Small Room is locked and require a successful **DC 14 Dexterity (Thieves Tools)** check to enter without alerting the undead inside. Attempting to break the door will succeed on a **DC 12 Strength (Athletics)** check. Surpassing the DC by 5 points or more grants the party a surprise round in the next combat, while failing  by 5 or more - to become surprised.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Skeletal Mage** *(SotP, p.134)*
* 2x **Swarm of Rats** *(SRD, p.390)*

##### Tactics:
The spellcaster in this room is alert of the intruders if a fight breaks off in an adjacent room, and he has cast Mage's Armor on himself. The swarms of rats will try to attack the smallest of the adventurers, while the caster will start the fight by casting Hold Person on the seemingly largest threat.

##### Environmental Hazards:
On the floor, some partially decomposed bodies are scattered throughout the room, some of them may potentially rise up as Zombies, if the encounter proves to be too easy.

##### Treasure
The only item of note is an iron key, found by the Skeletal Mage. It fits into the doors to the Shrine.
}}

Aside from the entrance, there are four other doors in this room. A double door to the left, made of reinforced wood, opens the way to a wide, bloodied corridor; upon its wall there are spikes soaked in crimson. It leads to the Animation Chamber.

First doors to the right are closed by a magical lock. They are impossible to open without a key or at least proficiency with Thieves' Tools, after a successful **DC 25 Intelligence (Thieves' Tools)** proficiency check. They can be opened with a Knock spell. Behind the doors, there is a Treasure Chamber.
 
Second doors to the right are mounted at the end of a 10 ft. long corridor, and lead to the Side Crypt.

The doors ahead lead to a small room, with a partially non-functional trap.

{{note
After you enter this enclosed space, an iron crate falls behind you, smashing into the floor.  You hear loud, repeating clicking. Expecting to get hurt, you flinch, but otherwise - nothing more seems to be happening, and the clicking sound suddenly stops.
}}

Way ahead is blocked by a set of iron doors that can be opened either with a successful **DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** check, or with a key found by the skeletal mage.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote PART 1 | INTRODUCTION }}
\page

#### Treasure Chamber
The Treasure Chamber is a 10 ft. by 10 ft. room filled with treasure gathered from the bodies of the deceased, taken from the graves of the cemetery above.

{{descriptive
##### Treasure:
There are a lot of items of common use, but amongst them are some pieces of jewelry and gems, as well as some coins. A pair of 2 silver rings worth 20gp each, a gold ring worth 100gp, 53 silver coins and an amulet with a small sapphire, worth 300gp can be found amongst the items here.
}}

#### Side Crypt
A 15 by 35 feet room, with an entrance barred by an iron door. There is no lock on them, but they are barred from the other side by a metal rod. Breaking in requires a successful **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** check. If it is successful with the first attempt, the undead inside are surprised. If not, they will pull the lever, which hides the metal rod in the wall, unlocking the door. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Wight** *(SRD, p.354)*
* 1x **Ghast** *(SRD, p.311)*

##### Tactics:
If the metal rod had not been destroyed, the undead inside will attempt to trap one of the adventurers inside, pulling the lever to block the doors again. It requires an action (but no ability check) to pull the lever; but a successful **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** check to break the rod. 

##### Treasure:
Right by a rotting corpse of a mariner, there is a pouch with 34gp, 25sp and 12cp, as well as a simple dagger.
}}

#### Animation Chamber
Right after a short corridor with bloodied barricades, there is  an octagonal room with a very large table in the middle, around which a circle of blood has been painted on the floor. Attempting to detect magic provides the party with information about a faint aura of Necromancy  present in the room. Near the walls there are 3 large stone sarcophagi. Half of the room is dimly lit by the torches on the wall opposite of  the entering corridor, the other half is almost completely dark.

\column

Quick investigation can lead to the conclusion that the undead were animated in this room, and guessing by the sizes of the restraints prepared to contain creatures on the table, some were much larger, than even a goliath.

Religious symbols, as well as a small effigy lie upon a smaller table, in the corner of the room. They can be recognized easily as symbols of the dark god, and gathered to provide proof of necromancer activity in the city, perhaps allowing the priests to further investigate the matter at a later time, through divination magic. Trying to scry on the effigy's creator reveals him to be a pale, skinny human, living on the outskirts of the city.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Ogre Zombie** *(SRD, p.357)*
* 1x **Ghast** *(SRD, p.311)*

##### Tactics:
The undead in this room have disadvantage on perception checks made to detect the adventurers, as the sarcophagi are thick and muffle the sounds adequately well. They themselves are impossible to detect without opening up the sarcophagi.

If the party is detected, the undead rise up, and attack the party, possibly surprising them, however lifting the cover takes an action from each of them. On top of that, they are considered prone at the start of initiative count.

##### Treasure:
Various spellcasting ingredients accumulated in this room are worth 250 gp in total for an alchemist. Additionally, there are six  short swords, two shields, three hide armors and two spears in this room. 
}}

#### Shrine of the Dead
The largest room in this underground has its floor filled to the brim with human remains, some of them even still animated. Right across the entrance, there is a large relief of a death god, and beside it - an altar, glowing with necromantic power, with a bloody-red skull upon it. There is no cover to hide behind in this room, aside from the altair. Destroying the skull causes the undead in this room to become vulnerable to all damage. The skull has 14 AC and 1 hit point.

There is also a passage to the left, wide, but with mysterious devices mounted upon both sides of a slightly narrower frame, flickering with blue energy - an electric trap, guarding the way to the Laboratory.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 8x **Skeleton** *(SRD, p.346)*

##### Tactics:
The skeletons mindlessly attack any living beings that enter the room, but are unwilling to leave their post. They will not pursue the adventurers, but will prepare themselves to shoot arrows at opening doors, if alarmed with noise from adjacent rooms.

##### Environmental Hazards:
As the entire room is filled with brittle bones, it is considered a difficult terrain. Additionally, a clearly visible electrical trap is mounted on a wall in a passage to the next room. It deals 2d10 Lightning damage, halved on a successful **DC 12 Dexterity** throw.

##### Treasure:
Upon the altar, there is a considerable treasure accumulated as an offering for the death god - five gems worth 50 gp each, 3 golden rings worth 70 gp each, and an amulet with a small sapphire worth 200gp.
}}

#### Laboratory
The first thing that can be seen in this room, by the desk, on  a three legged stool, there is a corpse of an old, pale man - the same that had been seen in alchemical shops recently, and the same that raised the undead, though clues would have to be gathered to deduce or divine it.

A successful **DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation)** check is enough to find a small collection of notes, written in Abyssal. They document the research of the wizard, and explain the presence of an empty vial on the floor - the necromancer wished to become a lich, and in his madness believed to have found the recipe for the potion - but, as evident - he was mistaken.

In this laboratory, there is a huge collection of dark tomes, most of which have withered with time, and a couple of scrolls - notably, three scrolls of Animate Dead and a scroll of Revivify.

### Resolution
The Church of the Grave is grateful for taking up the task of this investigation, and -besides the promised reward - offers to identify one magical item of the party's choice, free of charge, and to provide them with one of the reasonably comfortable, unused rooms by the temple at greatly reduced price.

## Chapter 6
# Auctionhouse of Bodies
}}

### Quick Overview
As a yearly event, a special auction is being held at Sorsaler city, by one of the wealthy nobles of the area - always in a different place, but always attracting the rich and immoral. Slaves, magical artifacts and historical items of great value change owners in this place. A person is to be sold at this year's auction, and it seems that some in the criminal underworld have expressed great interest in buying them, with clearly evil intention - be it revenge or a wish for cruel exploitation. They need to be saved, but involving the watch will surely spell doom for them!

{{note
**Recommended level:** 5
:
**Expected Enemies:** Humanoids, Beasts
:
**Reward:** 1000 gold pieces
}}
### Obtaining the Quest
The Auction is a yearly event, and so, even though the criminal underworld likes to keep it low-profile, some rumors circulate amongst the lower and medium classes of the city. A visit to a tavern may be enough to get to know about the event. A **Charisma (Persuasion)** check will reveal additional information as per the table below:

|DC   |Additional Information Gained|
|:----|----------------------------|
|10| The auction is a great time to buy talented or attractive slaves, rare magical items, and exotic animals. |
|15| This year's auction attracted a mysterious man, dressed in gray, who seems to have unlimited resources. |
|20| This year's auction takes place in the house of a nobleman by the name of **Clant Fierce** |
|25| This year, to enter the auction undisturbed, one has to have a rose glided in silver pinned to his hair. |

If not through rumors, the quest is given via a proxy, when a messenger dressed in white clothes with golden gliding approaches the party, noting their particular reputation, and asking them to urgently arrive at **Gloremar Manor**, where **Lady Lydia Gloremar** wishes to discuss a 'delicate matter'. The party might have heard of the lady in passing, as a reputable widow with considerable wealth and influence on the city Council, through her familiarity with the current Master Artisan, and her frequent donations to various charity organizations of the city.

\column

### Meeting in Gloremar Manor
**Lady Lydia Gloremar** is not a person to greet her guest immediately in person, instead on arrival, the party will be introduced into the mansion by one of the servants. After a short wait, **Lady Lydia** will enter the room appointed to the party.

**Lady Gloremar** is a tall, beautiful elven woman, usually wearing golden clothes and adornments. Though usually she enjoys honeyed words and acts of courtesy, this time she is distraught, and so she proceeds to a simple manner of conveying her wishes.

Recently, one of her favored servants has disappeared, apparently kidnapped from the streets by some thugs. Of course, the City Watch had soon after traced the bandits, and captured them, freeing the hostages, but the servant was not amongst them. A couple of weeks later **Lady Gloremar** discovered through a private investigation, that her servant is to be sold at the Auctionhouse of Bodies - a yearly event where the undercity gathers and exchanges illegal goods - slaves, with perfectly falsified certificates of ownership amongst them. The reputation of the house **Gloremar** doesn't allow the lady to act herself, or through one of her associates, and the City Watch is too corrupt to act efficiently in this manner, and so she resorts to mercenaries. Aside from the promised reward, she gives the party a large sum of money, to cover the cost of buying back her servant if they see it as the best approach, and the information on where the auction will take place - but unfortunately, no invitation, leaving the party to figure their way in themselves.

### Getting into the Auctionhouse
The auction is organized in the house of **Clant Fierce**, a local noble with some connections to the criminal underworld, at night. Some figures in the city have received invitations; they are instructed to send their representatives with a uniform sign of being there on orders from someone trustworthy  - silver-gilded roses pinned to their hair. This fact can be overheard as unconfirmed rumors in any tavern, but there are ways to confirm it.

If the party had previously been working for, and remain in good relations with Augury, she might provide them with an invitation, or even send the party herself to recover a particular trinket, coercing

the party into an agreement as a price for the information. 
 
Perhaps the party had already found an invitation, or were given one from other criminal in the city - for example the **Queen of Thorns** from one of the other short adventures might be in possession of one of them.

Otherwise, investigating the matter of previous year's passes, the party might discover that every time it is a particular type of jewelry - asking around in various jewelry workshops in the city for any sudden spikes in sales might confirm that this year's pass is in fact, a silver-gilded rose. They are being sold for 40 gp each - and this cost might be covered by **Lady Gloremar**, if the party provides her with that information.

Entering the premises of **Fierce Manor** without such marking will almost inevitably lead to the guards being alarmed, and the intruders to be dealt with accordingly. The guards can be deceived into letting the party in on a successful **DC 25 Charisma (Deception)** check, or bribed with a successful **DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion)** check, and 20 gold pieces per party member. If the party knows of the gilded flowers, both DC's are lowered by 5, as they can claim that the entire stock had been bought off. The guards might believe it, as it had happened a year ago. On entering the Auctionhouse, firearms and large weapons, such as halberds, glaives, greatswords and crossbows are taken to a small building beside the manor, and kept under guard, but the party is allowed to keep armor and other, smaller weapons (such as longswords or mauls).
 
### Encounters
#### The Courtyard
At the courtyard of the mansion, there are two armed guards on warhorses, patrolling the area. They will investigate all visitors briefly, focusing their attention on everyone not wearing the gilded rose in hair.
{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Knight** *(SRD, p.400)*
* 2x **Warhorse** *(SRD, p.346)*

##### Tactics:
The knights are riding their warhorses, using lances to hit-and-run the characters without ranged options, or closing up the gap to characters with ranged weapons. They will, however, not target characters looking like mages first, in hopes that they have no license for spellcasting.
}}

Any characters wearing the pass are free to go, after a quick introduction - but the only building they are allowed free entry is the mansion itself.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### The Auctionhouse
The great hall of the **Fierce Manor** is currently refashioned into an auctionhouse. Massive, oaken tables stand in one end of the room creating a scene upon which the items being auctioned are being presented to the representatives gathered in the name of various influential figures in the city.

There is a **Mimic** that is disguised as the slave that would be sold at a given moment. It is being paid by the criminal underworld, and is there willingly, but is instructed to not show too much enthusiasm. The transformation happens offstage, in the backrooms, as to not disturb the buyers. The people to be sold as slaves are being kept in the cells below, tied up and gagged, ready to be given to the highest bidder.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Mercenary Commander** *(SotP, p.135)*
* 4x **Thug** *(SRD, p.402)*

##### Tactics:
In combat, at least two thugs do their best to protect their commander. When one of the enemies is killed, another one will run towards the back rooms to get help.

##### Environmental Hazards:
Large fireplaces in the main room have iron fences with sharp spikes, that might make it difficult to get out of the fire.

##### Treasure:
Thugs have a total of 463 gold pieces divided amongst them. One of the thugs is wearing a *+1 Studded Leather*. The Commander has a *Scroll of Hold Person*, which he can use during a fight.
}}
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The people inside don't check for the invitation, nor the gilded flowers, but a particularly odd behavior may draw attention and further questioning. Intruders would rather be seized and sold than killed.

The servant being auctioned is being bid on by some of the criminals. Feel free to role-play the bidding if the party wishes to engage in it. Ultimately, the price for a young slave should not exceed 500 gold pieces. If the party cannot pay immediately in coin for purchases made, they will be asked to provide the invitation (each of the invitations has been secretly marked to identify the buyer if payment has to be delayed). Failure to comply is met with hostility, even if the party has the gilded flowers on them.

The main hall has many doors to various other rooms in the manor, notably kitchens, storage room, servant's quarters, master bedroom, and an office.

No items of note are left there, as the houseowner **Clant Fierce** had emptied the building of valuables. The office is locked with a magical lock, impossible to open without the Knock spell or similar magic.

On the far end of the room, behind the makeshift scene, there is a pair of wooden doors, which leads into the stairway to the cellars.

#### Cellar Stairs
At the bottom of the stairs, in a room with a stone floor and red brick walls, there is a table by which three guards play cards. They are at service of the criminal eminence that organizes the Auction, and might not immediately be hostile if the party tries to pass themselves as new mercenaries, as it was expected that some would arrive this day to discuss the terms of employment. They will be directed to the office in the southern part of the cellar.

If the party however enters the cellars with gilded flowers on them, the guards will chase them away up the stairs, as the customers are not allowed there.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Priest** *(SRD, p.401)*
* 1x **Mercenary Apprentice** *(SotP, p.135)*
* 1x **Knight** *(SRD, p.400)*

##### Tactics:
The Mercenary Apprentice has Mage Armor cast on himself, and the Priest is fighting using an Exquisite Warhammer.
:
The guards try to contain the party into this room. If one of them dies, one of  the others will try to run towards the nearby bedroom to wake up two berserkers to help out. They can come back as quickly as the next round.

##### Environmental Hazards:
There is a large holding cell in this room, and the guards can use a free action to lock the door. A melee-focused party members might become a target to lure or push into the cell. Breaking the slightly rusty iron door requires a successful **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** check.

##### Treasure:
A golden amulet worth 250 gold pieces, an *Exquisite Warhammer* and a *Scroll of Fireball*.
}}

\column

#### Large Cell
Right near the staircase, there is a larger containment cell in which some of the captives are being held - more specifically, the ones that the Auctionhouse had already sold, and will be dispatched to the buyers at the end of the event.

The prisoners that have not been paid for yet are not being moved into these cells, and remain in the prison cells deeper into the cellars.

#### Corridors
Each of the rooms in the cellar is connected by a system of narrow corridors, lit by some torches upon the walls. In the far ends of this underground complex, in the east and west, there are 7 sets of holding cells on each side, where prisoners are kept. Each of the iron-barred cell doors are locked, and can be opened with a successful **DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** proficiency check, or with a key held by the **Orc Warchief** on the guard post, or a copy held by the **Mercenary Mage** in the office.

#### Guardpost
There is a table set up with three chairs, upon which **Mercenary Commander** is guarding the cells alongside two of his strongest goons. He is on a first-name basis with all of the mercenaries, and can therefore immediately recognize any intruders.

From the junction in the corridors in this place, the holding cells are visible. The prisoners inside are intimidated into staying silent, and if approached, they will back off to the far wall.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Mercenary Commander** *(SotP, p.135)*
* 2x **Ogre** *(SRD, p.336)*

##### Tactics:
The mercenary commander is trying to rally his ogres as much as possible, using his War Cry feature at every opportunity. In turn, his goons attack the greatest threat to their boss

##### Treasure:
The commander has a universal key to the prison cells, and the office near the southern wall.
}}

#### Private Showroom
At the center of this large cellar, there is a large room that at first glance has served as a torture chamber of sorts, guessing by the chains on the wall, and large, tilted table with manacles on the corners, there are also stains of some unidentified liquid on the floor.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 5x **Orc** *(SRD, p.308)*
* 2x **Dire Wolf** *(SRD, p.371)*

##### Tactics:
The orcs have been drinking heavily, and 3 of them are considered poisoned. Nonetheless, they are overconfident, and will not try to call for help, until the last one remains.

##### Environmental Hazards:
In the middle of the room, on a slight elevation, there is a hidden mechanism, that releases a trap-like contraption, which binds the victim, unless it succeeds on a **DC 12 Dexterity** saving throw. A character is considered Restrained until another character uses an action to release him.
}}
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The orc mercenaries hired to keep the prisoners in the calls gathered here to eat, drink, and socialize. In the corners of the room, there are also two dire wolves, brought here by them, in case there is need to track some escapees. They are well-trained and obey commands spoken in Orcish, and they recognize friend from foe, on top of being fiercely loyal to their master.

From inside of this room, there is a pair of iron-reinforced doors that lead to the office. A prolonged fight in this room will alarm the **Mercenary Mage**, unless one of the orcs confirms to him through the door that the intruders have been dealt with.

#### Bedrooms
The bedrooms are located in the eastern part of the cellar, right opposite of the prisoner cells. The walls are thick enough to block off most of the noises coming from other rooms, which makes it possible to sneak into them without alarming the mercenaries inside.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Berserker** *(SRD, p.397)*

##### Tactics:
If the berserkers haven't been alarmed by other guards, or disturbed by excessive noise, they are lying on their beds, and are considered prone and surprised.
:
Otherwise, if they expect intruders, they take position on both sides of the door, waiting to strike.

The bedrooms, aside from a couple of spare weapons, are empty of any interesting findings, as they are used daily by the servants of the **Fierce** family.

#### The Office
The last room in  the cellars is a classy office, with expensive furniture: bookcases, desk and chairs, and an exquisite rug. There is little light  - only candle by the papers lying on the desk, as the **Mercenary Mage** wizard named **Grex**, assigned to take care of the entire operation this year, is finishing the formalities of slave trading.

The doors are locked, and require a successful **DC 17 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** proficiency check to open. Failing this test alarms the **Grex** of the party presence, and might convince him to gather up the papers and leave through the opposite door, to leave the mansion.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Mercenary Mage** *(SotP, p.135)*

##### Tactics:
**Grex** has mage armor cast on himself. During confrontation, he will try to use his magic to defeat the party, but if no reinforcements arrive by turn 3, he will try to escape, possibly using the Wall of Ice spell.

##### Treasure:
**Mercenary Mage** has 2 *Scrolls of Fireball*, and a *Scroll of Greater Invisibility* on himself, as well as a *Greater Potion of Healing*.
:
If **Grex** had no time to gather up the ownership documents of the slaves, they are also there, on top of the desk, otherwise, he takes them with himself.
:
In the room, there are two paintings worth 300gp each, and in the drawer of the desk there are seven emeralds worth 100 gp each.
}}

### Resolution
Saving the servant of **Lady Gloremar**, be it with violence, stealth or simply buying her from the criminals during the Auction helps the party to establish an influential ally. Of course, they will be refurbished for the costs, along with the promised reward. As a bonus, the lady might assure the party that she will be of service if they need any help.

Her influence is enough to provide the party with an audience with the City Council itself, if there is need for it; perhaps she can broker off the initial quest of the ***"Shards of the Past"*** campaign.

## Chapter 7
# Alexander Grisseaux
}}

### World Wanderer
The main villain during the campaign, even when he is not present in the flesh is a Realm-Traveler **Alexander Grisseaux**. In his own world, he was a powerful mage in his own right, wealthy, respected, and beloved by people. A flick of his staff was enough to solve all problems that would dare arise against him, until a certain bad day happened.

His beloved wife and daughter became sick with disease that quickly spread through their bodies, and consumed his wife, leaving the child fighting for dear life, all the while **Alexander** stood powerless with no possibiity to save them.

Extensive studies revealed to him that there was no cure in his world; and so he ventured, racing with time itself, on a journey through worlds, to strip them of their secrets, to return home with a miracle, and save his daughter from certain death.

Many worlds had he visited - some barren, many flourishing with life, but none have given him the answer he was seeking. Until a certain time, when he departed from a barren, icebound world, he felt as if some unknown force ripped him from the inbetween, throwing straight before a strange building - a citadel made of metal, shining lights of glass and a voice of stone, that spoke in a language unknown. That was the first time **Grisseaux** saw something he could not comprehend. Would THIS world hold the cure?

### First Steps in Next World
**Alexander**'s attempts at accessing these strange buildings - built by a race of which Antarriah's denizens know only that they have been worshiped by a civilization ancient and gone now - had been unsuccessful. His magic had no effect, his strength was nothing before the unmoving steel. He had to seek help.

Throughout his travels, he discovered that the world - or at least this part of the continent he visited - had been sealed from magical travel, which filled his heart with great worry. Bit by bit, learning the history of these lands, he correctly deduced that over 400 years ago, when the demons invaded the prime material plane, and opened the abyssal gates in his strange land, the archmages of this world had done something - and between the verses of ancient tomes he recognized, that undoubtedly it had something to do with the cities of metal he witnessed. And it could be reversed. It had to be reversed if he were to go home.

### Get Inside the Tomb
**Alexander** quickly forged a number of fake identities to establish his influences in the city, earning the name 'The Gray Man' in the city. He managed to kidnap, coerce, or pay off the greatest of the scholars on the subject, who helped him open one of the Tombs, left by the Ancients, and discovered inside a true wonder; a machine mind, greater than any man he witnessed through his long worlds-voyage.

**Grisseaux** had used the artificial intelligence to gain access to the City of Steel, an ancient complex surrounding the place he initially landed on, and then deliberately damaged the tomb on the Eastern Desert, to not be followed. He would need time, after all. It took months, but finally, he had opened the unmoving gate, and entered the Forge of Guardians, a factory with capabilities to create an army of soldiers cold, unfeeling, but obedient. Servants that would search the world for him, while he worked on unlocking the Realm-Travel.

Currently, **Grisseaux** is working near the Forge of Guardians, to break archmagi's enchantments, to be able to venture forth into another world - or, with some luck, if the army of living metal had found the cure - to his own. To his daughter.

### Bonds, Flaws, Ideals
- **Grisseaux** is obviously bound to his family, or whatever's left of it. No sacrifice too great, no price too high; he'd gladly destroy this world and crush a thousand more if it could save his child.

- **Alexander**  had become too confident in his own abilities, having encountered no equals to himself in the matter of the arcane arts. He is, however, blind to the fact that he is not the only one with noble intentions. Another, obvious flaw of his is his cold ruthlessness.

- **The Gray Man** believes that power makes a man. The influence over the world is all that matters, and for this reason, he cannot fathom the thought that his quest is doomed to fail, and his  daughter is beyond saving. The possibility of failure is worse than death.

### Powers, Allies and Influence
**Alexander Grisseaux** is an extremely powerful, knowledgeable wizard, as well as prodigious detective, charismatic leader and a capable warrior. In his home realm he had a vast trove of magic items:

- **Robe of an Archmagi**
- **Staff of the Magi**
- **Arcane Grimoire**
- **Crystal Ball of Mind Reading**

That is of course in addition to a number  
of scrolls, potions and wands, which make him  
a foe to be reckoned with in a direct fight.

In the Free City of Sorsaler he had gained not many friends, but a number of associates. These  
include:

* **Augury**, the tiefling girl, whom he personally helped to attain total power over the criminals in the city, making her a powerful ally.

* **Baron Devon**, the owner of the East-Antarriah Trading company, for whom he delivered a large amount of rare blue crystals, that are but a waste produced by the Forge of Guardians.

* **The Forsaken Sons**, a mercenary guild, bought with gold and the promise of gaining the command of the metallic army once Grisseaux departs.

{{letter,note
I will not stop in my efforts, and you shall double yours. I hope  I will not need to repeat this:

*My will be done*.
}}

He of course also commands other forces, outside of the Free City: 

* **The Mechanical Army** created by the Forge of Guardians, scouring the deserts in search of other locations built by the Precursors, which may contain a cure for his daughter, **Anastasia**.

* **Black Smile Tribe** - group of gnolls commanded by terrifying Blacfur living in the caves granted to them by Alexander, after he cleared them off monsters on his way to the Tomb of the Precursors on the Eastern Desert.

### The Endgame
As the story progresses, **Alexander** turns more machine than man, making use of various enhancements designed by the precursors. By the end, there is little more than a vivid memory of a man he once was, but the determination remains, not out of love, but a programmed sense of duty.

**I am sorry, Anastasia**

## Chapter 8
# Following The Gray Man
}}

The beginning of the journey through the lands of Antarriah is marked when the party is called upon by the City Council of Sorsaler; the message being passed by a messenger, or one of the guards. Perhaps, if the party had been hiding well, the special group of the City Watch know as the Brute Squad will find them and bring forth to the chambers of the council, or - if they had hidden their location particularly well - a magical mist created by Praras, the Protector will reach them nonetheless, conveying the call before disappearing. The means of contact are ultimately irrelevant

The mission that the Council proposes is considered sensitive, and therefore to be kept secret, and it involves the recent emergence of ancient constructs over the entire region - and a mysterious figure known by most as **the Gray Man**.

### Overview
The City Council had been informed for months about the activity of various groups of interest and mercenaries, that seemed  to be connected with a common goal - in effect of which the city's foremost experts on the Ancients - a race long ago extinct, worshiping mysterious gods, that have since vanished.. There is no telling who and why is behind this, but as the guardians of the ancient temples wake, and become more persistent in driving off the caravans, the City Council has to take  action.

The investigation could begin with one of the victims families or associates, and should finally  led the party to search for the **Lost Archives**, that were once underneath the free city, but had been lost to time. Their best bet is to go through the city sewers.

### Missing Scholars
The three missing scholars have been all studying the Ancients for many years, and - save for Master Abjurer **Praras** and maybe **Archmage Hasedoki**:

* **Vergan Bardot**, scholar in the Sea Academy
:
* **Magister Zeyk**, member of the Mages Guild
:
* **Nathaniel Bane**, retired adventurer
:
**Vergan Bardot** had been addicted to Blue Sugar, a cheap, illegal drug. Perhaps asking around in poorer districts, or amongst known criminals could give the party a hint what happened to him, and perhaps a lead towards his whereabouts.

**Magister Zeyk** had been conflicted with the clergy of the grave, but for some reason he sought refuge in their temple shortly before his disappearance. It would be foolish to accuse the priests of having anything to do with it, but perhaps they know what was it that scared Zeyk so much that he turned to them for shelter.

**Nathalien Bane** had been seen seeking artifacts of the ancients on the black market - he was supposed to arrive at this year's Auction, but a word says that neither he, nor any representative had made it; guessing how he was seen departing one of the city taverns into the direction of this year's event, he must have disappeared on the way.

#### What happened to the scholars?
Recently hired by a man named **Alexander Griseaux** mercenary company - the **Forsaken Sons** - is working in the city, hunting down people who might have any knowledge of the **Lost Archives**. The mercenaries don't know the name of their benefactor, aside from the owner of the company of course, who personally struck the deal. Mercenaries have been successful in finding and kidnapping two of the scholars - namely **Magister Zeyk** and **Nathaniel Bane**. With their knowledge, and the resources of strong-armed men of the **Forsaken Sons**, one of the entrances to the **Lost Archives** had been unraveled in the sewers, and as of now, some of the mercenaries are clearing up the place - with the scholars being forced to accompany them.

One of the missing scholars - **Vergan Bardot** had disappeared for a different reason, only coincidentally at the same time. He is currently held by **Augury**, the crime boss, in the basements of the **Ragnarok's End** inn for stealing a stash of supplies of the blue sugar. The tiefling woman is vengeful, but can be reasoned with; and might be willing to part with her prisoner for a lump sum of money, or a favor from the PC's. Knowing her reputation, the favor would be probably immoral, and certainly highly illegal.

In either case, **Augury** is a woman of her word, and will honor the agreement, releasing **Vergan** relatively unharmed - aside from him being previously bruised and traumatized by her thugs. The scholar has some information on the localization of the rumored **Lost Archives**, and could provide a hint towards the general location of where the sewers could connect with some of the entrances. His guidance allows to proceed further, into the Sewers.

{{footnote PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST }}
\page

### Sewers
All of the leads have led  the party towards searching the sewer system of the Free City - more specifically its more remote areas, accessible from manholes in the streets near the cemetery.

Probably unbeknownst to the adventurers - at least yet - there is a small tribe of wererats living in the wet tunnels, trying to scrape by on whatever the denizens of the city throw away - leftovers and slops from the homes of unaware people from the world above. They loathe the 'upper-worlders' for leading comfortable lives, with full stomachs, while they starve. On occasion, the tribe barters with the criminals of the city, to stock up on clothes and food, in exchange providing the criminals with portions of the treasure taken from the Lost Archives.

Recently, a band of Forgotten Sons, had passed through the sewers, into the library; a fight had broken off between them and the wererats, with some casualties on both sides. As a result of this fight, the mercenaries have broken into the Lost Archives, but have been locked from outside by the werecreatures.

This part of the sewers is clearly not safe; monsters roam the tunnels; from the aforementioned wererats, through giant spiders and ettercaps to a couple of Ankhegs, who have drilled their way into the sewer system. If the party is slow in making progress through the corridor, you can roll a d20 to determine a random encounter.

##### Random Encounters
|D20  | Encounter in the Sewers |
|-    |:------------------------|
|1-5  | 1d6 Giant Spiders       |
|6-10 | 1d8 Giant Rats          |
|11-15| 1d4 Ankhegs             |
|16-20| 2 Wererats              |

### Encounters in the Sewers
As the party makes their way into the older part of the sewer system, and keeping their direction more or less north-centric, they will encounter a passage overgrown with webbing.

#### Ettercap Lair
This narrow space is a lair of a nasty ettercap, and his two giant spiders.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Ettercap** *(SRD, p.308)*
* 2x **Giant Spider** *(SRD, p.379)*

##### Tactics:
Ettercap tries to drag grappled creatures away.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The entire terrain had been covered in webbing.
}}

#### Dark Corridor
Not far from the ettercap's lair, there is a passage between two parallel sewer lines, occupied by a band of wererats. They are quick to violence, as they have been clearly disturbed with the recent attack. They can be reassured that the party means them no harm with a successful **DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion)** check.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Wererat** *(SRD, p.327)*
* 1x **Giant Rat** *(SRD, p.378)*

##### Tactics:
The werecreatures do not have ranged weapons, and rely only on their bites.

##### Treasure:
On the floor, in a pile of discarded weapons, there are two *silvered daggers*.
}}

Closer inspection of the corridor gives clear clues, that the wererats have been fighting some other force before; discarded weapons, bloodstains on the wet stone floor are clues enough, but a successful **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check is enough to notice also some cut off fur - whomever they fought, fought back.

#### Putrescent Room
Both of the doors to this room are locked, with rusted locks that are impossible to pick, and wouldn't be any easier to open even with a key. Even though they were clearly built to be sturdy, time and humid air had worked up their way through the materials, and a successful **DC 12 Strength (Athletics)** check is enough to cave the doors in.

From inside of this 20ft. by 10ft. room, a rusted manhole in the ceiling can be seen. More pressing though is the horrid smell of rot, coming off of a Shambling Mound that dwells here.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Shambling Mound** *(SRD, p.345)*

##### Tactics:
The creature follows and attacks the closest enemy.

##### Treasure:
Amongst the rubble, trash and other dejecta, there is an old stash of some unfortunate thief, who apparently wasn't able to retrieve his loot. In the partially destroyed leather bag, there is a gold amulet with a large diamond, worth 600 gold pieces.

}}

#### Murky Pool
In one of the side tunnels, two ankhegs have broken through the walls, creating a large clog of loose stones, dirt, and mud, which has created a pool of smelly water. The creatures have been lured here by rotting food, but they do have a taste for fresh meat as well.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Ankheg** *(SRD, p.264)*

##### Tactics:
The monstrosities work in tandem, trying to drown the adventurers. They prioritize downed characters.
}}

Other than the clog, there is nothing much else of interest, as this corridor ends with a dead end.

#### Musty Room
A spacious room dug out between the corridors of the city sewers is a lair or the wererats, and not without a reason, as the creatures have unearthed one of the two stairways (the second stairway to the south-east of there) into the Lost Archives.

For a couple of years, this tribe had been retrieving trinkets and treasures from this place, and selling it to the people who in return supplied them with food.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Wererat** *(SRD, p.327)*
* 3x **Giant Rat** *(SRD, p.378)*

##### Tactics:
Wererats are tired after a fight that has recently broken off with the gnolls, and so they try to escape when they fall below 20 hit points, leaving their pet giant rats to fight to the death.

##### Treasure:
A key to the Lost Archives, two silvered longswords, a diamond worth 100 gold pieces, a *+1 studded leather* and a *silver dagger* lie amongst ragged clothes in the wererat lair.
}}

\column

### Way Further Ahead
From this part of the sewers, there are two paths to explore further. The party can choose to venture through the tunnels to the north, leading them to the Undercity Crypt, an optional location, where a formidable vampire has established its lair. Alternatively, they can opt to open the massive doors that beckon them into the profound depths, granting access to the Lost Archives, a place brimming with forgotten knowledge and untold secrets.

### Undercity Crypt
This long abandoned part of the city sewers, below the now uninhabited part of the city is a lair to a vampire that had recently begun to abduct and kill citizens. This northern part of the city underbelly also houses a number of other undead, subservient to him, and several other monsters.

#### Foul Smelling Room
Right behind the left side wall of the corridor leading to the undercity crypt, amidst the stink of rotting corpses and excrement a bunch of ghouls feast on some unfortunate dog who must have fallen into a sinkhole, and drifted with the current.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 8x **Ghoul** *(SRD, p.311)*

##### Tactics:
The ghouls can be easily surprised, as they are occupied with devouring a dog at the moment of the party's arrival. However, they will become alarmed by the sounds of combat from other rooms, particularly if the party engages the Otyugh in the adjacent room.

##### Environmental Hazards:
There are multiple holes in the ground, which is entirely covered in shallow but dirty water. When a creature steps into space where there is a hole requires a successful **DC 13 Dexterity** saving throw, or its speed is reduced to zero. If a creature fails this throw by more than 5, it falls prone. Getting out of the hole takes an action.

}}

#### Carrion-Filled Well
Opposite of the room where ghouls feast on the unfortunate pet, there is a room cluttered with broken bones, torn clothes, and pieces of wood that some time ago probably formed a wardrobe. In the middle, there is a well, 4-feet tall above the floor level. 

Adventurers that enter the room may become manipulated by the Otyugh inside the well, by being shown some kind of treasure waiting in the depths of the well.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Otyugh** *(SRD, p.339)*

##### Tactics:
Once (and if) the creature emerges from the well, it will do its best to drag as many other creatures into its sunken lair with it.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The well in the middle of the room has steep walls, and at the very bottom of it there is a deep, cold natural cave filled with water.

##### Treasure:
There are several trinkets and toys gathered amongst garbage, worth a total of 43 silver pieces, and a *+1 Studded Leather*.
}}

\column

#### Ritual Room
Cluttered with broken furniture, apparently quickly shifted from the middle of the room to make space for an arcane sigil, this room had been once a refuge of one of the necromancers of the Cult of The Dead - before he had been killed by the vampire who recently took residence in this part of the sewers. 

Unfortunately for him, he had been brought back to unlife by his master, to spread the curse of undeath, dependent in his sorry state upon the whims of the bloodsucker that ended his existence just like he was subservient to his mortal masters.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Embergheist** *(SotP, p.133)*

##### Tactics:
The embergheist in this room, when opened, engages in combat by casting fireball, after which it attempts to run through the corridor over the shambling mounds, to alert the Skeletal Hexslinger in the aforementioned ritual room.

##### Treasure:
There is a *Scroll of Fireball* on one of the tables, lying on top of a Greatsword and a *Chain Shirt of Fire Resistance*
}}

#### Putrescent Room
Surrounded with old books of the arcane, barrels barely held together with rusted hoops, an almost completely decayed remains, there is a tall chair, upon which a skull engraved by a skeletal hexslinger present in this dungeon with foul symbols. It's facing south-eastern doors to the room. Upon opening either pair of the doors, a horrible stink of death and decay spreads through the frame.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Skeletal Hexslinger** *(SotP, p.134)*
* 4x **Shadow** *(SRD, p.344)*

##### Tactics:
The shadows do not act on their own initiative, but instead act at the beginning of the Skeletal Hexslinger's turn, and target the enemy chosen by him (if they can). When the Skeletal Hexslinger is defeated, the shadows roll for their own initiative.

##### Environmental Hazards:
When standing in the middle of the ritual circle, the Skeletal Hexslinger regains 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn, unless he has taken damage from critical hit or radiant damage from his last turn.

#### Opening Into Natural Caves
Connected to the underground rivers that flow beneath the city and find their ends in the openings of the stone ground upon which Sorsaler had been built, the sewer system has a portion that spills the filth of the city into the oceanic currents. The walls of the corridors have not been maintained for years, resulting in some of them collapsing and leaving openings into natural caves like the one present here. Notwithstanding its small size, enough filth had accumulated in this particular cave to create not one, but two Shambling Mounds of garbage, which now lie in the corridor motionless, waiting for a stray animal, such as a rat swept away by the current of the sewage.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Shambling Mound** *(SRD, p.345)*

##### Tactics:
The Shambling Mounds are motionless, until a creature moves into their space, or they take damage.

##### Treasure:
About a dozen of swords, daggers, spears and axes are embedded into the bodies of the creatures, and can be gathered after defeating them.
}}

#### Room with Wide Stairway
On the way to the crypt lies a lair of some of the spawn that were created for the sole purpose of guarding the vampire from the wererats present in the sewers. These servants have been placed on post near the only accessible entrance of the crypt, which is the way up the wide stairway.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Vampire Spawn** *(SRD, p.354)*

##### Tactics:
The vampire  spawns cling to the ceiling of the room, and a passive **Perception** score of **17** is required to detect them, unless the characters specifically look around on the ceiling. The spawns attack when they can drop on top of a character, or whenever they are detected.

##### Treasure:
Both of the vampire spawn have *silver daggers* on them. The weapons and weapon dice used by the vampire spawns could be switched if the increased challenge is deemed appropriate.
}}

\column

In this room, there is also a large, wooden mezzanine overlooking the area. Two sets of stairs lead up and down from it. On top of the mezzanine, there are chests and crates containing a horrifyingly large amount of items stripped from people who were snatched by the vampire. These items were taken away from the dead before what remained of them had been tossed over to the ghouls or the Otyugh.

#### The Crypt
Lying on the ground between four columns that support the ceiling, a wooden casket is located in a ruined room situated above the level of the rest of the sewers, accessible through the mezzanine in the previous room. 

{{descriptive,
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Vampire** *(SRD, p.352)*

##### Tactics:
The vampire can use a bonus action to crush one of the four beams supporting the ceiling, in hopes of restraining his enemies.

##### Environmental Hazards:
Each of the four support beams holding the ceiling can be knocked down, forcing every creature in 5 ft range to make a **DC 14 Dexterity** saving throw, or become restrained. A creature can use its action to make a **DC 13 Strength (Athletics)** check to free itself from under the rubble, which becomes difficult terrain.

##### Treasure:
Amongst the treasures accumulated by the Vampire, there is a stash of 7 pearls worth 100 gp each, a diamond worth 500gp, a silver chest worth 50gp filled with coins of value equal to 352 gold pieces; as well as a *Life-Stealing Dagger* with a red handle, longsword with the name "Varscona" engraved on its snow-white blade in gnomish runes, two *Scrolls of Animate Dead*, and an *Adamantine Half-Plate*.
}}

The walls, adorned with carpets that were once expensive but now destroyed by the humid environment, have hangers that hold exquisite weapons. The room is illuminated by dozens of candles on the floor, burning with a silent roar, providing a bright ambiance. A strong rose scent emanates from the candles, masking the unpleasant smell of the sewers.

### The Lost Archives
The Lost Archives of Sorsaler have garnered a truly legendary reputation. A repository of supposedly unlimited knowledge of time and space, magic and technology, divine and mundane - however impressive the truth is, the contents of the actual library are bound to disappoint. After the earthquake that collapsed most of the tunnels and rooms, there was not much else to discover, that hadn't perished, either devoured by insects, rats, or succumbed to the humid air.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The mercenaries of the Forsaken Sons have found a way inside, and are in the process of securing the rooms, mapping out the space, and trying to locate any knowledge of a way to unlock Temples of the Ancients - monumental structures raised by an extinct and almost forgotten race, who worshiped a strange pantheon of gods unknown or lost in time to the people of today.

It appears that their master is intensively trying to breach the gates of one such complex, hoping to access some powerful, magical device of old.

\column

#### Rune-Lit Room
The adventurers enter the room and are immediately struck by the sight of a massive skull resting in the center of the space. The skull belongs to a dragon or some other similarly impressive creature, and it is surrounded by a series of runic symbols that seem to glow with a shimmering green light.

Two mercenaries from the Forsaken Sons stand guard on either side of the skull, their weapons drawn and ready to defend against intruders. Nearby, a wizard from the same group is busy studying a series of ancient tomes, searching for clues about the Temples of the Ancients.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Forsaken Sons Mercenary** *(SotP, p.136)*
* 1x **Forsaken Sons Wizard** *(SotP, p.136)*

##### Tactics:
The mercenaries will try to surround the party and attack with their weapons, while their commanding wizard will try to stay back and use ranged spells to support the mercenaries. If the party tries to flee or retreat, the mercenaries will pursue and try to cut them off.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The stacks of books and artifacts may be unstable and could collapse if disturbed, potentially causing injury to anyone caught in the collapse. There are also several open flames in the room, including candles and a small fireplace, that could potentially cause a fire if not handled carefully.

##### Treasure:
Wizard of the Forsaken Sons has a *Wand of Wonder*, which he can utilize during the fight.

\page

The room itself is large, at least 50 feet in each direction, and it is filled with stacks of books, scrolls, and other artifacts. It is clear that the mercenaries and the wizard have been here for some time, as their supplies and equipment are scattered about the room.

As the adventurers approach, the wizard looks up and meets their gaze with a cold, calculating stare. "What do you want?" he demands, his voice laced with hostility. It is clear that the adventurers are not welcome here, and the mercenaries look ready to attack at a moment's notice.

#### Abandoned Office
The adventurers enter the abandoned office and are immediately struck by the feeling of neglect that permeates the space. The room is small and cramped, with a single window letting in a sliver of dim light. Dust covers every surface, and cobwebs stretch between the corners of the room.

Two mercenaries from the Forsaken Sons are busy searching the room, their movements illuminated by the soft glow of a single lantern. One of the mercenaries holds the lantern aloft, casting long shadows on the walls as he moves about the space. The other mercenary is rummaging through a series of old filing cabinets, his brow furrowed in concentration.

The room is sparsely furnished, with a single desk and chair taking up one corner. The desk is cluttered with papers and other debris, and it is clear that it has not been used in some time. Despite the mercenaries' efforts, it seems that the room holds no clues or treasures of value.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Forsaken Sons Mercenary** *(SotP, p.136)*

##### Tactics:
The mercenaries, if they realize they are outmatched, will try to retreat into other parts of the archives, seeking help from their allies.

##### Treasure:
One of the mercenaries had found and pocketed a Ruby worth 100gp. The other has a purse containing a *Scroll of Cure Wounds*, and 23 gp.
}}

#### Bonfire Room
The adventurers enter the room and are immediately struck by the heat and light of the huge bonfire that burns in the center of the space. The flames dance and flicker, casting an orange glow on the walls and illuminating the figures of three mercenaries from the Forsaken Sons as they search the room.

The room itself is large, at least 50 feet in each direction, and it is filled with a variety of old, broken furniture and other debris. The mercenaries seem to have been here for some time, as their supplies and equipment are scattered about the room.

One of the mercenaries is tending to the bonfire, adding more fuel in the form of an ancient tome that he has pulled from the shelves lining one wall. The other two mercenaries are rummaging through the clutter, their faces lit by the flickering light of the flames. Despite their efforts, it seems that the room holds no clues or treasures of value. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and the sound of the mercenaries' footsteps echoes off the walls.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Forsaken Sons Mercenary** *(SotP, p.136)*

##### Tactics:
The soldiers of the Forsaken Sons are busy with searching the room, and are therefore easy to take by surprise.

##### Treasure:
Two of the mercenaries have *Potions of Greater Healing*
}}

#### Corridor
The adventurers move cautiously down the dark, narrow corridor, their senses heightened as they sense danger lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, two luminous spheres - magical anomalies - come rushing towards them, swirling masses of tentacles writhing around them as they try to reach the adventurers.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Magical Anomaly** *(SotP, p.137)*

##### Tactics:
Magical anomalies prioritize targets with the strongest magic available to them - by highest level unspent spell slots, or most powerful magical items.

##### Environmental Hazards:
As the corridor is narrow, but high, the anomalies can hover above the party, freely moving above them, which makes them able to target chosen targets.

If the anomaly takes hold of someone wielding a ranged weapon, or someone who primarily casts spells, they can move grappled adventurers towards themselves, using their own movement speed.

##### Treasure:
After a magical anomaly is defeated, the lights die out and a diamond worth 300gp slowly floats down to the floor.
}}

{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}

#### The Crystal Chamber
The Crystal Chamber is a small, dimly-lit room that is cluttered with a variety of strange and ancient artifacts. One wall is lined with shelves filled with old tomes and scrolls, while the opposite wall is adorned with a series of strange symbols and symbols that seem to glow with an otherworldly light.

In the center of the room stands a crystalic device that pulsates with energy. It is clear that the device is of great importance, and a Forsaken Sons wizard stands guard over it, his eyes fixed on the crystal as he mutters an ancient incantation.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Forsaken Sons Wizard** *(SotP, p.136)*

##### Tactics:
The wizard makes use of the scrolls he has with him.

##### Treasure:
The wizard has a number of scrolls on him, including: a *Scroll of Fireball*, two *Scrolls of Acid Arrow* and two *Scrolls of Magic Missile*.
:
The crystal in this room can be sold to the Mages Guild or other similar organization. It is worth 1000 gp.
}}

The purpose of the device is unclear, but it seems to be some sort of magical focus or conduit. It is possible that the wizard is using the device to tap into otherworldly powers or to communicate with other planes of existence. It will be up to the adventurers to uncover the truth and decide whether to try to use the device for their own purposes or to destroy it and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.

#### The Library Arcane
The Library Arcane is a large, musty room filled with rows upon rows of bookshelves. The shelves are lined with rotten, decaying books, their pages yellowed and crumbling. The air is thick with the smell of mold and decay, and it is clear that the room has been abandoned for some time.

However, despite the general state of disrepair, one book stands out from the rest. It is well-preserved, its cover and pages intact, and it seems to have been carefully protected by the illithid who dwells in this room. The illithid sits at a large, ornate desk at the far end of the room, its tentacles writhing as it pours over the pages of the book.

The book contains the clues that everyone has been searching for, and it is clear that the illithid has been studying it intently. The adventurers must decide whether to try to steal the book and risk angering the powerful illithid, or to try to negotiate with it and persuade it to share the knowledge contained within its pages.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Greater Magical Anomaly** *(SotP, p.137)*
* 2x **Magical Anomaly** *(SotP, p.137)*

##### Environmental Hazards:
The rows of bookshelves could provide cover for the enemies, but they could also potentially be knocked over or set on fire if the battle becomes heated.

##### Treasure:
On top of one of the tables lies *Frost Branded Quarterstaff +1*
}}

### Resolution
The book recovered from the Illithid contains information about the location of one of the Temples of the Ancients that had not been unearthed yet. It appears, that the lands have changed it's shape somehow, since the book had been written, but the location of the Temple is characteristic enough that it can be said with relative certainty, that it should be somewhere in the middle of the Eastern Desert of Antarriah - a place that had been plagued with dangerous beasts, but recently - also a growing tribe of Gnolls.

The City Council promises great reward for tracing the Temple, and scouting the area. The knowledge contained in the  book might allow the party to follow through with that order, or undertake the search for the ancient site on their own, in hopes of gaining unfathomable wealth and glory. Whatever the case might be, and however long their search might be, all of the clues will lead them to the caves of the Black Smile Tribe.

## Chapter 9
# Caves of the Black Smile Tribe
}}

### Entrance to the Caves
Upon entering the caves, a split in the tunnel can be observed, and a set of large doors is located at the branching paths. The door grants access to a cave utilized as a communal space by the gnolls. The boards are sparsely spaced, allowing for discrete observation. Right of the diverging paths leads to a narrow bridge spanning a chasm containing toxic water. The path to the left descends slightly, encircling the communal area before ascending towards a watchpost overlooking an underground stream.

#### Gnoll Common Area
A sizable grotto, situated in proximity to the entrance of the cave, functions as a communal area for the gnolls. Within this cavernous space, the gnolls engage in socializing and crafting weapons. The room is characterized by the presence of several large stalactites, which partially obscure the view of the surroundings. Additionally, a plethora of tools and materials are scattered throughout the area, creating an atmosphere of clutter.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Berserker** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 5x **Gnoll Hunter** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
The gnolls shoot their bows into the intruders, depending on a larger Gnoll Berserker to engage in melee combat, but if he falls - they all pull out their spears. In general, the gnolls prefer to focus on one opponent at a time.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The large furnace in this room burns brightly with hot coal. Anyone pushed into it suffers 2d8 fire damage the first time it enters the area, and when it ends it's turn there.

##### Treasure:
There is a complete set of Smith's Tools, two *Potions of Healing*, and a heavy crossbow on one of the tables near the furnace.
}}

Despite the importance of the area to the gnolls, they exhibit a lax attitude towards their surroundings, making them an easy target for anyone who may seek to exploit their vulnerability. In fact, the gnolls produce a significant amount of noise, which can be heard from outside the doors of the grotto. Overheard conversations reveal that the gnolls converse in their native language (Gnoll), discussing a curious discovery made in the underground river, situated below their location.

### Gnoll Prison
To the north of the main chamber lie makeshift doors that lead to a narrow corridor. Two curtains hang from the walls - one of which conceals a room containing two heavy iron cages, while the other leads to a foreboding torture chamber.

#### Cave with Cages
Used as a prison for hapless wanderers who unwittingly strayed too close to the gnolls' domain, this confined space now holds nothing but the remnants of the unfortunate souls who were once held captive here. Their bones have been stripped clean, but the gnolls left behind some of their belongings by the cages, as they have no use for treasures that cannot be used to further their murderous ways.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Pack Leader** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 3x **Gnoll Brute** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
The pack leader prefers to stay back and order the other gnolls around, only stepping in when directly attacked, or more than one Gnoll Brute is defeated.

##### Treasure:
Amongst the treasure lying around the skeletons in the cages, there is a *+1 Hide*, and a *Ring of Mind Shielding*.
}}

Hidden in the corner of the room, behind a loose stone, lies a small stash that had been cleverly concealed by one of the gnolls during their watch duty. Upon successfully passing a **DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)** check, the stash can be discovered. Inside the small wooden chest, there are three *Potions of Greater Healing* and two *Potions of Water Breathing*, a magic ring - *Step of the Battlweaver* can be found, along with a golden amulet worth 300 gold pieces, and four pearls worth 100 gold pieces each.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

\page
![BlackSmileTribe MAP](https://i.imgur.com/a8xl7VV.jpg) {position:absolute,left:0px,top:0%,height:100%}
\page

However, the most valuable discovery in the stash is a sketchbook containing detailed drawings of the Old Machines, along with notes describing their tactics, strengths, and vulnerabilities. Among the sketches, a Helio Tank is mentioned, warning the characters of the threat it poses. It is advisable for the party to exercise caution when confronting such  an enemy. The **Helio Tank** is known for its devastating laser beam, capable of penetrating even the strongest armor.

#### Torture Room
Within the confines of this enclosed space, interrogations were conducted with brutal efficiency. The gnolls employed various forms of torture to extract information from their unfortunate subjects. Regardless of whether the subjects cooperated or not, their fate was ultimately the same - to be devoured by the ravenous pack of hyenas that roamed the area. At present, a knight by the name of **Andoriel** is being subjected to the gnoll's twisted methods of interrogation. Recently captured while passing through the desert, she was brought here by the gnolls, who saw her as an easy target.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Brute** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 3x **Giant Hiena** *(SRD, p.376)*
##### Tactics:
As the tortures are in progress, the gnoll and the animals are considered surprised, even if the party produces a lot of noise beforehand - as the executioner is too focused on his current subject.
The Hyenas always attack whomever attacked the gnoll last, as they are trained to protect their master. They scatter around if the gnoll is killed.

##### Environmental Hazards:
On the walls of this cave, there are many spikes, and thus any character pushed into a wall will receive additional 1d4 piercing damage for each 5ft of forced movement.

##### Treasure:
A healer's kit with 6 remaining uses, and a *+1 Whip* can be found in this room.
}}

**Andoriel**, a member of the Order of the Golden Rose, was on a mission to reach a village on the other side of the desert before heading south to Harmon's Reach. Unfortunately, her journey took an unexpected turn when she stumbled upon the gnoll lair. The gnolls showed no mercy, and now she finds herself bound to the torture machinery, her fate hanging by a thread. Despite her predicament, **Andoriel** remains resolute. She refuses to betray her mission or her order, even under the most brutal of circumstances. Rescued by the party, she will agree to help with clearing out the cave, and can provide some useful information to the party.

After killing **Blackfur**, **Andoriel** decides to travel back to the monastery, and invites the party with her.

{{note
##### What does Andoriel know?

While the noble knight had not been really let out of the cage before being bound to the torture chair, she had been in the cave long enough to notice a few things, when the gnolls have threatened him in a few ways.

* There is one larger gnoll, who definitely rules over the Black Smile Tribe, but it seems that he is speaking with fear of some man whom he only describes as **The Gray Man**. This gnoll leader has his throne in the northern part of the cave, and it seems that his name is **Blackfur**.

* The gnolls have access to a source of a particularly powerful acid, in high quantities. Andoriel saw it melt through another prisoner's arm in seconds.
}}

### East Branch of the Caves

#### Bridge over Toxic River
Between the entrance and the kitchen, a small natural bridge spans a pit filled with acid, enclosed by a pair of doors. The pit spans 25ft. wide and 30ft. deep, with acid filling it up to the halfway point.

The room emanates warmth, and a gentle gust of wind can be felt, as the heated air from the kitchen escapes the caves. The noise of gnolls mumbling and the aroma of roasting meat can be sensed from the corridor ahead, detectable with a successful **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Brute** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 3x **Gnoll Hunter** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
The gnolls in this room try to take as much advantage of the acid below, and will cooperate to push the adventurers down from the bridge.

##### Environmental Hazards:
There is a pool of dangerous acid below the bridge. Any character who would fall there takes 10(3d6) acid damage the first time it enters the pool, and every time it ends it's turn there.

##### Treasure:

Under the acid, at the bottom of a pit, there is a *Ring of Protection*, and an *Amulet of Health*, but they are not visible from above the surface of the liquid.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

#### Kitchen
Occupying the second-largest cave in the complex, the gnoll kitchen is a hub of activity. Mighty roars can be heard as several fireplaces are lit, roasting meat to perfection. The smell of the fel liquid in the overflowing cauldrons is overpowering, a noxious scent of decay that permeates the air.

The rough tables scattered around the room are coated in a shiny layer of spit, a testament to the gnolls' voracious appetite as they devour their meals. The remains of stews and other dishes can be seen smeared across the tabletops, their surfaces still wet and slick.

Despite the unappetizing surroundings, the gnolls take pride in their culinary skills. They are experts at preparing even the toughest meats and can turn the most unpalatable ingredients into a delectable meal - at least for gnoll taste.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 8x **Gnoll Berserker** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
As the Gnolls in the kitchen are feeding, it is easy to surprise them. They beeline for the party members which have the most injuries sustained, and if they manage to knock someone unconscious, they will hurl themselves on the incapacitated character and try to eat them.
}}

### West Branch of the Caves
#### Stream Watchpost
The gnolls have erected a watchpost over a narrow stream, complete with ample lighting and even a wooden table for their dice games during sentry duty. Additionally, the cave boasts a plank bridge spanning 10 feet in length and 5 feet in width over the same stream.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Gnoll Gnoll Berserker** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 2x **Gnoll Hunter** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 1x **Gnoll Pack Leader** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
The gnolls try to push back the attackers, but if overwhelmed, one or more will try to escape to the sleeping area, to warn the rest of the tribe of the intruders.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The stream below might prove to be a hazard for characters wearing heavy armor.
}}

At the end of the cave complex, the stream disappears into a narrow gap between the rocks. While it is possible to swim through it, doing so is no easy feat. The current is swift, and the gap is so narrow that one false move could mean getting stuck or injured.

To navigate this treacherous passage, one would need to make three consecutive successful **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)** checks. Even then, it would be a risky venture, as the stream starts in the pool near the Fiendish Throne.

|Area|On failure|
|-|-|
|First Area | Character is pushed back, and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage on the way. |
|Second Area| Character is pushed back to the First Area, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on the way|
|Third Area | Character is pushed back to the Second Area, and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage on the way |

Each successful ability check allows the character to swim against the current for one minute, enabling them to cross the gap in as little as three minutes. However, a failed check will result in the character spending more time underwater and increases the risk of drowning. If a character drowns, they will be immediately swept towards the watchpost area.

#### Gnoll Quarters
Upon entry to the wide chamber, an abundance of pallets can be seen strewn across the floor, providing clear evidence that this cavern has been chosen as a lair by an entire tribe of gnolls. The area still contains some resting gnolls, likely after a hunting trip the previous night.

The room's atmosphere is filled with the smell of sweat and unwashed hair, as cleanliness and appearance are evidently not a priority for these creatures. Walking amidst the beds elicits an uneasy feeling due to the presence of fleas hopping around the space.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Brute** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 5x **Gnoll Gnoll Berserker** *(SotP, p.139)*

##### Tactics:
Three of the gnolls in this room are asleep, and waking them up becomes a priority for the remaining three.

##### Treasure:
A golden set of dice, worth 250 gp is on the table, along with four pearls worth 100 gp each.
}}

Amid the shabby animal furs, which the creatures have employed as protection against the cold, a stolen box belonging to **Blackfur**, is discovered.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

The box is currently locked and can be opened only through a successful **DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves Tools)** proficiency check. Upon unlocking, it is revealed that the box contains three amethysts, each worth 150 gold pieces, two potions of healing and a letter outlining orders to the Black Smile tribe, as follows:

{{note,letter, 
##### Blackfur

It has come to my attention that your tribe has become complacent. I have new servants now, far more useful, even if sparse - for now.
:
I trust you don't have to be reminded of what had happened to the Crooked Teeths.  Serve me well, so I will not have to replace you.
}}

The letter is written on fine paper, with a neat writing. Analyzing the ink proves that it is an  expensive sort, not found on Antarriah, but imported from Faerun. An information, that you should not disclose freely to your players, is that the note had been written by one of the **Gray Man**'s associates. Mister **Griseaux**, at the time of writing this note, he didn't have the means of preventing his enemies - real or imagined - from scrying on him, and so he carefully avoided creating any traces with which he could later be traced by.

### River Chamber
Upon entry to the last chamber of the Black Smile Tribe caves, the deafening roar of a waterfall can be heard. The large chamber is divided into two by the underground river, which flows from east to west. A considerable portion of the stream can be seen pushing itself under the rocks, heading further south until it emerges at the gnoll watchpost.

On the northern bank of the river, a few small rocky outcroppings can be used as stepping stones to cross to the other side of the chamber. However, the strength of the water could easily knock an unwary adventurer off their feet, sending them downstream. The sound of the waterfall is almost overpowering, and the mist it produces rises high into the air, contributing to the already damp atmosphere. Despite the potential danger, the sight of the waterfall and the power of the water is mesmerizing, leaving one feeling humbled by the sheer force of nature present in this cavern.

#### Watchpost
The elite gnoll guardians are gathered around a small campfire, the flickering flames casting eerie shadows on the damp walls of the underground cave. As the party approaches, the gnolls growl and bare their teeth, clearly hostile to any intruders in their territory.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Gnoll Brute** *(SotP, p.139)*
* 2x **Gnoll Pack Leader** *(SotP, p.139)*

Both of the Gnoll Pack leaders fight with *+1 Glaives*, and the Gnoll Brute has a *Ring of Protection*. All three of these items can be looted from the creatures after they're defeated.
}}

These gnolls were the elite guard of **Blackfur** - the gnoll that had been coerced into service, and commanded to guard passage towards the Tomb of the Precursors.

#### Fiendish Throne
Behind the murky river, to the north, just beyond a rickety wooden bridge, looms a throne made of jagged stones and wicked-looking spikes. It is the seat of the pack leader, a fearsome gnoll named Blackfur. His throne is both magnificent and terrifying, a testament to his power and cruelty. The spikes jutting from the seat and armrests are stained with blood, and the stone is pitted and scarred.

Blackfur himself is a hulking figure, easily towering over the other gnolls in the pack. His fur is black as coal, and his eyes gleam with a malevolent intelligence. He sits on the throne with a sense of entitlement, as if the entire cave system belongs to him by right. The surrounding area is eerily quiet, as if even the creatures of the cave know to avoid **Blackfur**'s wrath. The river, which runs close to the base of the throne, is deep and treacherous, its swift current snatching at anything that falls into it.

##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Blackfur** *(SotP, p.140)*
* 4x **Gnoll** *(SRD, p.314)*

##### Tactics:
**Blackfur** leads the charge, trying to make the best possible use of its Aura of Bloodlust, and it has a strong preference towards melee combat.

}}

Defeating **Blackfur** and his minions open up the way towards a long corridor cut in stone, to the Tomb of the Precursors.

## Chapter 10
# The Inner Sanctum
}}
::
#### Natural tunnel
After traversing the twisting, winding caverns of the Black Smile Tribe, a vast corridor of natural stone stretches out before the adventurers. The passageway extends for almost a mile, with only the faintest glimmers of metallic plates visible on the walls. Despite the apparent age of the plates, there is no trace of rust or decay, as though the metal had been somehow fused into the very rock itself.

As the group approaches the end of the tunnel, a pair of imposing doors come into view on the right-hand side. The doors are crafted from an unknown metallic material, and are adorned with a plethora of intricate markings of unknown origin. The doors seem airtight, and appear to have been masterfully crafted to withstand the test of time.

\column
:::
As the adventurers approach the doors, two small lamps situated on either side of the entrance begin to flicker, casting an eerie, pulsing red glow throughout the corridor. With a faint hiss, the airtight seals on the doors release, and the metallic barriers slide apart, revealing the next chamber of the Purification Chamber beyond.

#### Purification Chamber
The entry doors to the purification chamber clang shut behind the adventurers with a resounding boom, leaving them momentarily blinded by the sudden darkness. The walls, ceiling, and floor of the chamber are constructed entirely of steel, with every inch of the room designed to withstand even the most powerful of blasts.

{{pageNumber,auto,color:#FFFFFF}}
{{footnote,color:#FFFFFF;  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

As the last member of the group steps through the threshold, a harsh, guttural voice booms out from hidden speakers. The language is unknown to the adventurers, but there is no mistaking the severity of the message. A moment later, a hissing sound emanates from beneath their feet, and a noxious gas is released into the chamber.

The gas fills the room with a vile, acrid odor, and an intense burning sensation washes over the adventurers. Each member of the party takes 1 point of acid damage from the noxious fumes, unless they had successfully passed through the chamber within the last 7 days. The gas continues to churn and swirl for a full minute, searing the eyes and throats of the adventurers.

Finally, the hissing noise dissipates, and the gas begins to clear from the chamber. As the last traces of the noxious fumes are sucked out through a ventilation shaft in the ceiling, the entry doors slowly grind open. Beyond lies the path to the main hall - a foreboding and mysterious passageway that promises to lead the adventurers deep into the unknown.

#### Main Hall
You step into the heart of the complex, a grand hall that stretches for 240 feet in length, 40 feet in width, and 40 feet in height, perpendicular to the entrance. The walls gleam with a smooth, silvery metal finish, while numerous glass panels emit a soft, red glow, illuminating the entire space. The floor consists of a sturdy concrete foundation that lies just two inches below a grid-like metal plate. As you walk along the corridor, you notice green plates positioned beside each set of metal doors, bearing cryptic symbols that you can't quite decipher.

Beyond the entrance, you notice a row of seven imposing sets of metallic double-doors, three on either side of the corridor, and one notably larger door positioned directly ahead of the Purification Room. All of them are presently shut tight, their robust construction rendering them virtually impervious to any external threats.

{{descriptive
As you step inside, a deep, resonating voice echoes through the space, repeating an odd, monotonous phrase a few times, before switching to more conventional language in the same tone:
:
***-Welcome to the Icarus Control Center. Kindly state the purpose of your visit.***  
:
This revised version seeks to enhance the sensory imagery and emphasize the contrast between the initial strange phrase and the subsequent plain language, while also making the request sound more polite and professional.
}}

The voice emanating from the depths of the complex belongs to an advanced AI system, responsible for managing and overseeing its operations since its mysterious construction by the long-extinct race of beings known as the precursors. Endowed with unparalleled cognitive capabilities and a distinctive personality, the AI was designed to store a vast trove of historical knowledge, but much of it has been lost or damaged over time. However, the AI's current state is in critical disarray, following an unprecedented intrusion by an unknown individual into the Icarus Control Center. This person somehow managed to bypass the complex's robust security measures, pilfering an experimental piece of technology - an Emergency Overrider - that could grant the user unrestricted control over the enigmatic Old Machines. In the process, the intruder inflicted significant damage upon the complex, perceiving the AI - referred to as **ICCAI** (*short for Icarus Control Center Artificial Intelligence*) - as a hostile entity due to its sophisticated hardware, impervious to the influence of the overrider.

{{note,letter
##### Motivate the party to cooperate!
While there may be several reasons why the party should care about the fate of **ICCAI**, they might be inclined to dismiss it and pursue the elusive **Gray Man** instead. In such a scenario, however, the AI might make a compelling case to convince them otherwise.

Firstly, as the overseer of the complex's archaic machinery, **ICCAI** possesses the ability to fabricate an upgraded version of the Emergency Overrider, should the need arise. This would undoubtedly prove invaluable in their quest to apprehend the Gray Man and prevent further harm.

Moreover, since the party remains clueless about the Gray Man's current whereabouts, **ICCAI** could leverage its vast network of surveillance resources to locate him. By tapping into its extensive spying capabilities, the AI can potentially provide valuable intel on the Gray Man's movements, motives, and plans.

Overall, the fate of **ICCAI** and the pursuit of the Gray Man are intrinsically linked, and the party's success in the latter may hinge on their willingness to heed the AI's advice and leverage its unique expertise.
}}

**ICCAI** has managed to mitigate much of the damage done, but repairs are needed if he is not to be irreversibly damaged, which the AI is programmed to avoid at all cost, and so it will try to instruct the party towards this goal.

\page

### The Damage Done
When the party agrees to assist the AI in repairing the complex, it relays crucial information about the damaged energy cell room. The AI states that the radiation levels are too high for them to enter and further diagnose the damage, even with the thick blast doors in place. However, there is a potential solution that could protect them from the lethal radiation - a rare type of ancient armor made from materials long forgotten.

Unfortunately, all the suits of armor are stored inside the sealed and affected area. But the AI has discovered the location of one such armor suit, approximately on the west coast of the continent, hidden in an underwater cave. **ICCAI** also shares that the armor was stored in an old naval base built by the Precursors, but the base's exact location and state are unknown to the AI. The AI offers low-level access keys to aid the party in their quest to retrieve the armor.

After providing this crucial information, the AI opens another door in the main corridor, leading to a new section of the complex. The AI urges the party to explore this section to gather more resources and prepare themselves for the dangerous mission ahead - the resting area will become accessible to the party from now on.

#### The Resting Area
As the party steps into the newly opened room, they are immediately struck by the feeling of comfort and luxury. The centerpiece of the room is a large artificial fireplace, which radiates a warm glow and provides a cozy atmosphere. A beautiful wooden piano sits in one corner, beckoning any musically inclined adventurers to play a tune. Several tables are scattered throughout the room, with warm lamps providing a soft, inviting light.

As the party takes in their surroundings, they notice the wooden floor beneath their feet. It's polished to a shine, with intricate patterns etched into the wood that give it a feeling of familiarity. The room is comfortably warm, with no hint of the cold, sterile metal that dominates the rest of the complex.

A smaller door leads to a clean and well-maintained restroom, complete with access to fresh water. Another door opens to a warm and spacious common bedroom, with several bunk beds providing a comfortable place to rest.

This area is clearly designed as a safe haven for the inhabitants of the complex, and the party can feel the tension and stress of their journey melting away. The room provides a welcome respite from the harsh environment outside, and the party can rest easy knowing that their belongings are secure.

\column

The wall of the main dayroom is adorned with a permanent Teleportation Circle, a powerful magical tool that can transport the party to any other Teleportation Circle they know of. In addition, a single scroll of Teleportation sits on one of the tables, allowing the party to make a quick escape if necessary. All in all, this room is a veritable oasis in the midst of the abandoned complex, providing comfort, safety, and a much-needed respite for the weary adventurers.

As the party approaches the pot plants, they notice the leaves are a vibrant green and appear to be well-nourished despite the long period of abandonment. The plants' growth is a testament to the vault's advanced technology, which has been able to maintain a perfect ecosystem for these plants to thrive in.

As they continue to explore the room, they realize that the lack of personal items or decorations gives the room an eerie feeling, as if it had been abandoned in a hurry. The absence of any records about the previous inhabitants only adds to the mystery, leaving the party to wonder what might have driven them away.

When asked about the vault's previous occupants, **ICCAI** responds with a hint of sadness in its voice. It explains that it was not programmed to know much about its makers or their past, but it senses a connection to them that it cannot explain. It promises to search its damaged memory core for any information it can find and share it with the party once its repairs are complete.

As for the Old Machines, **ICCAI** warns the party that extracting information from their memory cores may not be a straightforward process. The Old Machines were built with limited capabilities and may not have been programmed to store much data. Nonetheless, the AI assures the party that it will do its best to extract any relevant information and provide it to them.

#### A way ahead
Armed with the newfound knowledge of the supposed location of the armor appropriate for the unknowable danger locked behind the steel vault doors, the party will need to venture west, to search through the many sunken caves, in hopes of finding this forgotten base of the precursors. This may be a great opportunity to present the party with a number of naval adventures, but you, the Game Master, may just as well provide them with the correct location - a peninsula known as the Serpent's Coil, which hides smugglers cove.

## Chapter 11
# Armor of the Precursors
}}

### Beautiful Radiance
As the party journeys along the rugged coastline of Antarriah, they soon come across a secluded cove that seems to be surrounded by towering cliffs and dense vegetation. The sound of waves crashing against the rocky shore can be heard in the distance, and a salty sea breeze blows through the air. It is clear that this place has been hidden away from the prying eyes of the world for a long time.

As they approach the cove, the party notices that there is a narrow, winding path that leads down to the beach. The path is treacherous and overgrown with weeds and shrubs, but it seems to be the only way down. As they make their way down the path, they notice that it is marked with various symbols and signs, indicating that this place is not as deserted as they had first thought.

As they reach the bottom of the path, they are greeted by the sight of a large, sunken cave system. The entrance is partially submerged in water, and the walls are covered in moss and algae. It is clear that this place has been abandoned for some time, but the party soon realizes that it has been repurposed by a group of smugglers.

{{note,letter
##### Aboleth's Mind Controlling Powers

The Aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom** saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Additionally, the Aboleth can see and hear using the senses of all creatures it controls.

Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.
}}

Inside the cave, they find crates of contraband stacked high against the walls, and various pieces of equipment scattered around the floor. The air is thick with the smell of salt and sea, and the sound of lapping waves echoes through the cavern. It is clear that this place has been used as a secret hideout for some time, but it changed with the arrival of the **Aboleth**. Drawn by the intense radiating power emanating from the depths of the sunken cave system, the malevolent creature wasted no time, and enslaved the people here. 

At first, the **aboleth** began its insidious plan by targeting the pearl divers who worked the waters around the cove. The ancient creature used its mind-controlling abilities to lure them into its grasp, and once they fell under its influence, they became its willing servants. As these slaves returned to the surface, the aboleth expanded its reach, influencing the minds of others who stumbled upon its domain. With each new victim, the aboleth's power grew, and it carefully avoided raising suspicion or creating new enemies for itself. The smugglers who remain are now little more than puppets, their minds completely subjugated by the creature's will. They go about their business with a blank, vacant look in their eyes, carrying out the aboleth's twisted desires without question, their moves jerky and unnatural.

#### Kindly Passersby
If the party seeks directions or guidance from the inhabitants of the cove, they will encounter a group of individuals who seem eager to help.

}}

These individuals will insist on personally leading the party to their desired destination, but in reality, they will be leading them to two of the strongest individuals in the cove who have succumbed completely to the Aboleth's influence. These two individuals, once human, now serve as the aboleth's enforcers, carrying out its will with brutal efficiency.

}}

After the encounter, the party senses that something unusual is happening in the cove. Suddenly, a young man rushes towards them from a dark alley and urgently gestures for them to follow him. It's clear from the fear in his eyes that he has something important to share.

### Jil Page
The man who urgently pulled the party aside is a scruffy-looking man with a wild look in his eyes. His name is **Jil Page**, and he introduces himself as a smuggler who arrived at the cove on the ship **Gray Squirrel**. He quickly realized that something was wrong when his crew began acting strangely, and he suspects that they fell under the influence of some malevolent force. He begs the party to help him and his crew escape the cove before they too become puppets of the aboleth.

{{note,letter
It all began even before we got to the cove. The uneasiness, the nightmares... the feeling of being watched all the time... One by one, the members of my crew started acting strange, and when we arrived, I knew better than to stand out. 
:
You'd better try to get that blank expression on your faces too, or you'll end up like them!
}}

Jil's care-free demeanor has been suppressed by the stress of trying to survive among the charmed people of the Cove. When around them, he puts on a blank stare and moves slowly, trying to cover up the fact that he has not fallen under the same influence as the rest. He is visibly relieved to be among the party, who express themselves much more openly.

{{pageNumber,auto,color:#FFFFFF}}
{{footnote,color:#FFFFFF;  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

He arrived at the cove almost a month ago and has been trying to avoid attracting too much attention to himself. The only reason he hasn't snuck out and left is that he cannot sail the ship himself. The party's appearance has given him hope that together they can take one of the ships and depart safely.

#### What does Jil know?
During his previous visits to the cove, **Jil** had befriended some of the pearl divers, who had shared their discoveries with him. They had ventured further and deeper than anyone before them, and stumbled upon a strange metallic structure hidden in the depths of the cove. The pearl divers were fascinated by their discovery and planned to return to the site to uncover whatever secrets lay hidden there. However, they have changed after they returned, and **Jil** suspects that their discovery might be the root cause of the strange happenings in the cove.

Unbeknownst to Jil, the cargo of the wrecked ship that was discovered by the pearl divers had attracted the attention of the malevolent Aboleth. The creature had been lured by the power emanating from the depths of the cove and had gradually exerted its influence over the pearl divers and the smugglers, using them to do its bidding.

Jil has also observed that the Aboleth's influence is strongest near the caves and underwater ruins where it resides, so he suggests that the party avoid those areas if possible. He believes that if they can find a way to break the Aboleth's hold over the smugglers, they may be able to find allies in their escape. However, he warns that the Aboleth is a powerful and dangerous foe, and they must be careful not to underestimate it.

Jil also shares some information about the smugglers' operations in the cove, including their schedule and routines, which could prove useful in their plan to escape. He suggests that they act quickly and quietly, and avoid drawing attention to themselves until they are ready to make their move.

Despite the risks, Jil is determined to escape the cove and is willing to work with the party to achieve their common goal, if they agree to help him operate his ship after.

### Into the depths
A resourceful party can use different strategies to find the Aboleth's lair. One option is to follow the smugglers at night, who are under the creature's control, and observe them as they are forced to dive deep into the caverns with pickaxes and other tools. It is clear that the Aboleth is trying to excavate something significant, perhaps the Tomb of the Ancient Ones. Another way is to search for underwater entrances or hidden passageways that may lead to the creature's lair. However, it's important to be cautious, as the Aboleth's influence is strong, and it has made its own defenses in place to protect its territory.

Another way is to ask **Jil** the location of the place the pearl divers used to go underwater, using divination magic, or perhaps even letting one of the party members fall under the **Aboleths** terrible mind control under controlled conditions, to survey information. It is also entirely possible that the party will dive in blind along the coast, eventually discovering the correct tunnel system.

#### Aboleth's Lair
Regardless of the method the party uses to find the aboleth's lair, they will arrive at an underwater ravine littered with ruined ship parts that have been carried there by strong currents. At the end of the ravine, the aboleth lurks in front of a set of large metallic doors that bear a striking resemblance to those found in the Black Smile Tribe Caves. The doors are sealed shut, but there are strange, mystical symbols etched onto their surface that seem to pulse with an eerie blue light.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Aboleth** *(SRD, p.261)*

##### Tactics:
The Aboleth will fight with confidence and cunning until it falls below half of its HP. At that point, the creature will try to make an organized retreat if it senses that it is outmatched. It will use its mastery of water to create obstacles and barriers to slow down the party and create opportunities for escape. However, if the adventurers are able to prevent its escape, the Aboleth will fight to the death.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The fight takes place underwater, and the area is considered Aboleth's Lair.  

##### Treasure:
At the entrance of the Tomb, there is a *Wand of Magic Missiles*
}}

The massive blast doors remained firmly shut even as the aboleth exerted its considerable strength upon them. However, as the adventurers approach, the doors begin to emit a faint glow and the sound of gears turning can be heard. The doors creak open, revealing a dimly lit chamber beyond. 

Although it may seem that the doors have been marked by some powerful - yet unknown to the adventurers - magic, likely the work of **ICCAI** or the Ancients, yet if someone uses *detect magic* spell, the doors bear no signs of magic at play. This is because  just like most of the Precursor technology is based purely on the laws of physics.

### Sunken Tomb
The imposing metal gate stood as the entrance to a vast and intricate complex constructed by the Ancient Ones, a temple dedicated to their enigmatic deities as the machine had foretold to the heroes. As they ventured inside, they were met with a myriad of religious frescoes and statues scattered throughout the area, each depicting strange and otherworldly motifs. Dominant among them were the images of birds and arrows, along with figures exhaling flames and - oddly enough - mushrooms.

#### Vertical Tunnel
As the party ventures deeper into the complex, they soon come across a steep slope that descends sharply into the depths below. The sound of churning water echoes through the temple, and the scent of blood fills the air as a pack of vicious sharks sense the presence of the intruders and launch an attack. With razor-sharp teeth and powerful jaws, the sharks lunge forward, their ferocity and hunger evident in their eyes. The party must fight for their lives against these formidable predators, using their wits and skills to avoid becoming shark bait.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Giant Shark** *(SRD, p.279)*
* 5x **Hunter Shark** *(SRD, p.282)*

##### Tactics:
The sharks are hungry, and always attack the enemy that is the most hurt. Any shark that falls below 20 HP becomes a valid target for other sharks.

##### Environmental Hazards:
As the fight takes place underwater, in a vertical space, adventurers need to take measures to not drown.
}}

#### Underwater Entrance
As the party descends down the slick slope, the aquatic flora slowly gives way to reveal a set of weathered stone columns, supporting the roof over an arched entrance leading to a long, dark corridor. The sound of rushing water echoes through the space, making it difficult to hear anything else.

Suddenly, a pair of Water Elementals surge forth from the depths, their bodies rippling with raw elemental power. The creatures move with startling speed and fluidity, their form shifting and changing as they assault the party.

Further ahead, in the dim light of the fluorescent creatures and fungi covering the walls of this section, there is a junction. Way to the north leads to a dead end, a dwelling of living whirlpools, while the corridor to the east will eventually lead the party to the Tomb.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The elementals are particularly dangerous in this environment: due to the warm waters, they are not affected with their Freeze feature, avoiding being slowed down on taking cold damage.
}}

#### Dead End
The narrow corridor suddenly comes to a dead end, with a large circular room at the end. The walls of the room are adorned with intricate carvings of sea creatures and plants, but they are covered in a thick layer of algae and coral. In the center of the room, there is a small pool of crystal clear water, surrounded by four living whirlpools. They seem to be guarding something, and their eyes are fixed on the party as they approach.

}}

#### Stone Corridor
As the party enters the Tomb, they find themselves in a stone corridor adorned with ancient art on its cold walls. The corridor stretches over a hundred feet until it turns left, revealing the entrance to the great hall of the Tomb. At the end of the hall, there are two vaguely humanoid shapes, guarding the way ahead.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Watery Guardian** *(SotP, p.145)*

##### Tactics:
As they are guardians of the Tomb, the elementals do not pursue fleeing targets, but will pursue characters attempting hit and run tactics.
}}

\column

The cave features a large air bubble connected to a narrow crack in the rock overhead, which is accessible through a broken section of the ceiling. Despite the narrow entrance, the air bubble is spacious and provides a safe breathing area for the party.

#### Great Hall of the Tomb
This sunken area is significantly more spacious than the narrow corridors of the temple, measuring over 50 by 200 feet. At the far end, the party can see what appears to be an altar or possibly a sarcophagus. However, the way forward is guarded by a group of highly territorial Killer Whales, presenting a significant obstacle for the party to overcome.

##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Killer Whale** *(SRD, p.383)*

##### Tactics:

}}

Above the altar, there is a much larger space that houses an air bubble. The bubble can provide the party with a safe spot to rest and recover from any potential dangers they may have encountered.

#### Blast Doors
After navigating through a winding tunnel, the party comes upon another set of blast doors, guarded by an unusual creature with a reflective, pink coating. The creature is in fact another one of the Old Machines of the Precursors, and is here to guard the entrance.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Thundershrimp** *(SotP, p.162)*

##### Tactics:
The machine guards the blast doors at all costs.

##### Treasure:
There is a dead body wielding a *+1 Trident*,wearing a *+1 Plate Armor* on the ground near the tunnel entrance - no doubt remains of some unfortunate adventurer, who perished here.
}}

Upon approaching the doors, they swiftly slide open, revealing a vast and dry chamber beyond. The air inside is surprisingly breathable, and the party can take a moment to catch their breath and survey their surroundings. At the far end of the chamber, a metallic ladder ascends upwards, stretching over 100 feet high, into the Precursors Complex.

Ascending the metallic ladder, the party reaches a hatch that leads to a system of corridors and rooms beyond. Upon opening the hatch, the party is greeted by a series of cold and silent corridors.

This place is an old naval base of the precursors, which served to test new fuel sources to power the Old Machines - and the experiments had been successful, which later led to the abandonment of the complex, which was left with only the automated defenses.

#### Sparkling Crystal Room
The first interesting room on the party's way is 35 by 35 feet. Most of the surface of the floor is taken by a large red crystal, sparking with energy. The floor and walls are made of dark gray metal sheets, and one of the walls seems to have a large glowing panel on them.

Ahead, a repeating humming of air, and swirling of water can be heard. Further investigation will reveal the turbines in the circular tank of water in the next room to be the source of the noise.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Flashound** *(SotP, p.161)*
##### Tactics:
The machines attack the target that is the closest to the crystal.
##### Environmental Hazards:
The crystal has an AC of 10 and 100HP. Every time it takes damage, a buzz of energy bursts out of it, dealing (2d10) force damage to each target in a 30 feet range. If the crystal is destroyed, all of the doors open due to this emergency, and all of the lights go off.
}}

#### Circular Tank
The next chamber the party can enter is a circular tank filled to the brim with water. Large turbines positioned around the perimeter of the room keep the water in constant motion, creating a gentle, almost hypnotic sound. The tank itself measures a staggering 70 feet in diameter, with the water level reaching just below the walkway that spans across the center of the chamber.

The walkway takes the form of a T-shaped metal grid bridge, providing a stable footing as the adventurers traverse the otherwise unstable surface of the water. On one end of the bridge, there is a solid wall. On the other, the bridge leads into a wider corridor that beckons with the promise of new discoveries.

Illumination in the room comes from hanging lamps positioned strategically around the circumference of the chamber. When powered, the lamps cast a soft yellow light that flickers in time with the movement of the water. However, should the power be disrupted, a dim, red light will flicker on and off, casting ominous shadows on the water's surface. The metal grid bridge is slick with moisture. A consistent motion on it may attract a deadly danger.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Thundershrimp** *(SotP, p.162)*
##### Tactics:
When machines become severely damaged, they dive deep underwater, and try to enter their repair stations.
##### Environmental Hazards
When a Thundershrimp reaches the repair station, it becomes incapacitated, and recovers 10HP per round until fully repaired.

}}

#### Main Corridor
As your adventurers delve deeper into the underwater base, they find themselves in a narrow corridor that's filled with an intricate network of tubes of various sizes. The tubes pulse with a faint blue light, a clear indication that the base's advanced technology is still functioning, despite its age.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The walls of the corridor are made of a sturdy, reinforced material, built to withstand the immense pressure of the surrounding water. The floor beneath their feet is smooth and slick, but not so much as to impede their progress. Overhead lamps cast a bright white light on the surroundings, making it easy for the adventurers to navigate through the tight space.

As they make their way deeper into the base, they'll notice that the tubes in the corridor grow in number and complexity, intertwining with one another like the veins in a living organism. The purpose of these tubes is unclear, and the technology behind them is sure to be a subject of fascination for any adventurers with a scientific bent.

The control chamber of the complex awaits at the end of the corridor, a room filled with the technology that powers the base. Here, the adventurers will find the secrets that have been hidden for centuries, waiting to be uncovered. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Control Chamber
As the adventurers make their way into the next room, they find themselves in a space that is equally as large as the water tank room they just left, but with one key difference - it's much higher. The walls of the room are lined with a complex network of tubes and pipes, their purpose unclear to the untrained eye.

In the center of the room, a large control panel sits, its many buttons and levers suggesting a high level of complexity. Two sets of heavy blast doors 

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page
stand at opposite ends of the room, each one clearly designed to protect whatever lies beyond them.

But it's the guardian that catches the adventurers' attention. Standing at the far end of the room, it's a powerful and menacing creature, its metallic body covered in pulsating black pipes, as it prepares to defend the space from any potential threats.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **FR 3323 (damaged)** *(SotP, p.164)*
##### Tactics:
This FR3323 is damaged, and therefore whenever it would fire off one of its Reflective Platings, they deal only half damage. Additionally, its Hit Points are reduced by 30.
##### Treasure:
Several (one for each party member) sets of *Armor of the Precursors* are hanging in a steel wardrobe in this room. They are covered in dust, but undamaged.
}}

As the adventurers approach the blast doors, after opening them they notice that one of them leads to a short, collapsed tunnel. The other set leads to a storage area filled with supplies such as copper wires, spare parts, and pipes. It's clear that this room was once used to maintain the equipment in the complex, and the adventurers can still see signs of the former occupants' handiwork.

Moving through this second room, the party can see that it leads to other areas of the complex. It's clear that the occupants of this facility had everything they needed to survive, at least for a time. But what's more interesting is what lies beyond this area.

As the party moves through the storage room, they can see that another set of these complexes opens up into a natural cavern. The walls are rough and uneven, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the space. Its natural environment has been incorporated into the design of the complex.

#### Ravine
As the adventurers continue to make their way through the cavern, they come across a deep ravine that blocks their path. The ravine is 20 feet wide, and the only way across is a narrow sheet of thick metal that spans its width.

The adventurers will need to cross this bridge if they want to continue on their journey, but as they approach, they can see that the bridge is guarded by a number of machines. The creatures are similar to the guardian they encountered earlier, but smaller and more agile. They move with a mechanical precision that suggests they are programmed for one purpose: to defend the bridge at all costs.

As the adventurers approach, the machines spring into action, their metallic bodies whirring to life as they move to block the party's path. The adventurers will need to fight their way past these guardians if they want to cross the bridge and continue on their journey. The metallic clang of weapons against metal echoes through the cavern as the adventurers engage in a fierce battle, their lives depending on their success.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* **4x Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*

##### Tactics:
The machines will try to make use of the bridge, which is a  choke point on the ravine.

##### Treasure:
In the corridor, by the wall, there is a metal chest containing some rotten food, and remains of a purse containing 45 electrum pieces.
}}

After the adventurers successfully defeat the machines guarding the bridge and continue on their journey, crossing the narrow sheet of metal that spans the deep ravine. As they make their way further ahead, they come across an unexpected obstacle.

The path ahead is covered with thick webs, but there are no spiders in sight - at least not of the size that the webbing would suggest. The webs are thick and sticky, and the adventurers will need to find a way to cut through them if they want to continue on their journey.

To the west, there is a wall of web that blocks the adventurers' path. The webbing is dense and impenetrable. A successful **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check is enough to determine that something is lurking beyond it. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*
* 1x **Flashound** *(SotP, p.161)*

##### Tactics:
Precursor Armors shoot any living creatures on sight.
}}

To the south, however, there is a narrow corridor that is covered in steel. The adventurers can see that this path is heavily fortified, and it seems to lead deeper into the complex.

As the adventurers weigh their options, they can feel the weight of the unknown bearing down on them. They know that danger and adventure await them, but they will need to choose their path carefully if they hope to survive.

}}

#### Webbed Cave
If the party decides to clear off the webbing from the walls, they can see that there are two machines entangled almost completely in the thick webbing. Despite being heavily ensnared, the machines are still functioning, their mechanical bodies whirring and clicking as they struggle to break free.

As the adventurers approach the machines, the whirring and clicking of their mechanical bodies grows louder. The machines seem to be aware of the adventurers' presence, and they begin to move, their appendages slowly disentangling from the webbing that holds them captive. It's clear that the adventurers will need to make a decision quickly if they hope to avoid a confrontation with these powerful machines.

{{descriptive

* 2x **Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*

##### Tactics:
The machines begin Restrained in the web (**Escape DC 13**)

}}

Unfortunately, stone walls of this part of the cave hide no secret passages, and so the party will need to find another way out - perhaps through the aforementioned steel corridor.

### A Way Out
Following the corridor for half a mile will lead the party to an open grotto, with entrance masked by thick flora. It can be easily cut down, allowing the party to leave the complex near the top of the cliffs in the region.

The path below is hidden, but not excessively dangerous. Unless the party uses magic, special equipment, or natural flight, it takes 2d4 hours to safely descend to the bottom.

{{note,letter,width:276px,margin-left:12px
After recovering the **Armor of the Precursors** there remains little to do in this place, and so the party should make it's preparations to return back to the Eastern Desert, and investigate the issues in the **Tomb of the Precursors**, now that they can be protected by the deadly radiation.

## Chapter 12
# The Flame Arcane
}}

Unfortunately, despite heeding **ICCAI's** advice and donning the powerful *Armor of the Precursors*, it became apparent that the core mechanisms had depleted all of their energy and no ordinary power source would suffice. However, **ICCAI** had received a distress signal which, based on its signature, suggested that even though no survivors could not have endured since the catastrophic impact that occurred over a millennium ago, there is hope as it indicated that the energy source may still be active and could potentially be compatible with the party's needs. Yet, the journey ahead would be arduous, leading the group deep into the heart of the Desert of the Ancients, towards one of the oldest standing structures on Antarriah.

### Travel through the Desert
Traversing the harsh terrain of this region is not for the faint of heart. The unforgiving environment demands that the group maintains a constant vigilance for potential threats while also ensuring they have enough water and food to keep themselves hydrated and nourished. The unforgiving surroundings may be home to dangerous beasts that could attack at any moment, making each step a potential peril.

To simulate the unpredictable nature of these hostile lands, it is recommended that the party rolls a six-sided die at the start of each day of travel. If the result is a six, choose one of the encounters from the random encounter table provided below. These encounters could range from a pack of hungry coyotes to a sandstorm that could engulf the group entirely. It is important to note that some of these encounters may not be winnable, and retreating or avoiding the conflict may be the wisest course of action.

##### Encounters in the Desert

|   8  | 2d4 **Ogres** *(SRD, p336)*                                 |

According to the instructions of **ICCAI**, the party must travel through a treacherous canyon to reach the secluded valley. Despite the long distance that separates them from their destination, their journey may take an unexpected turn when a messenger from the Temple of the Arcane Flame intercepts them. The messenger implores the party to accompany him to his monastery, where strange and inexplicable phenomena have been occurring that even the resident monks cannot explain. However, the chapel master in charge of scrying at the temple insists that the party pay them a visit, and he has something valuable to offer as a bargaining chip.

{{note,letter
"I humbly plead for your assistance. The pyramid lies before you, but alas, the gate remains sealed shut, impervious to all your attempts to open it. Our revered master **Aranthir**, however, possesses the knowledge to unlock its secrets and guide you to the labyrinth within. He has instructed me to request your aid in this endeavor, promising to reward your efforts with the key to the pyramid's gate. Will you lend us your strength and expertise?"
}}

### Temple of the Arcane Flame
The Monastery of the Arcane Flame is in turmoil, as its people grapple with the corruption of their most treasured possession: a magnificent phoenix of unrivaled power and majesty. Led by the revered Flamemaster Aranthir, the monks are at a loss as to what could have caused the creature to fall under the sway of dark magic. Desperate to reverse the curse and restore the phoenix to its former glory, the monks seek out the aid of powerful magic-users and holy warriors, willing to risk all for the sake of their beloved bird and the balance of power in the desert of the Ancients.  

As the heroes delve deeper into the mystery of the corrupted phoenix, they uncover a dark and sinister plot. A powerful sorcerer, who goes by the name of **Zoltar the Defiler**, had infiltrated the sanctuary of the Arcane Flame with one goal in mind: to harness the otherworldly power of the phoenix for his own nefarious purposes. This **Zoltar**, however, was not just any ordinary mage. He had cunningly disguised himself as a new initiate, earning the trust and admiration of the elders with his impressive magical prowess. But beneath his charming exterior lies a heart consumed by jealousy and greed, envy.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

Despite his relative youth, **Zoltar** had quickly risen through the ranks of the Arcane Flame, earning the respect and admiration of the elders with his prodigious talent and unwavering dedication. But his true intentions were far from noble. In secret, he had been preparing a diabolical scheme to siphon the power of the phoenix and bend it to his will. 

He had taken great care to protect his rituals against scrying and other forms of detection, utilizing powerful wards and enchantments to shield his work from prying eyes. With the phoenix's corruption growing stronger by the day, time is of the essence.

To uncover **Zoltar's** nefarious plan, the party will need to investigate the Monastery and interrogate its inhabitants. However, gaining access to the inner sanctum will not be easy. As a rule, the private chambers of the Flamemaster and the other high-ranking members of the cult are strictly off-limits to outsiders.

The heroes may attempt to persuade the Flamemaster to allow for a general inspection of all the rooms, but it will not be an easy task. A successful **DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion)** check may be enough to sway him, but he will remain cautious and hesitant. After all, the secrets of the Arcane Flame are closely guarded, and the monks are loath to let outsiders meddle in their affairs.

If the heroes are able to gain access to the private chambers, they will need to be on their guard. **Zoltar**, if he is aware of their presence, will undoubtedly be nervous and may attempt to hide any incriminating evidence that he did not expect to be discovered so soon.

### Private Quarters
Using spells that allow the user to detect magic in the premises of the Monastery reveals that almost every stone had been enchanted. Most areas give off a powerful aura of lingering evocation and transmutation magic, and every fireplace burns with blue fire maintained by these enchantments. However, one room in particular is heavily protected with strong illusion and abjuration magic - the room of **Zoltar the Defiler**. His room is constantly under the effect of the *Nondetection* spell. He is also proficient in using *Nystrul's Magic Aura*, which he can cast to mask either the presence or properties of the items in his room. If the party discovers any of these facts, it becomes easier to convince **Flamemaster Aranthir** of the necessity of searching the rooms, with the persuasion check reduced to a **DC 11**.

A thorough investigation of the private quarters may reveal several items that prove Zoltar's involvement in the corruption of the phoenix, unless he had the opportunity to hide, dispose of, or plant them in someone else's room:

* A depleted magical wand, which can be confirmed to have taken part in corrupting the phoenix with a successful **DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana)** check.
* A phoenix egg, the discovery of which is reason enough to expel any member of the monastery for sacrilege.
* A map revealing a path to the phoenix's nest, which can be confirmed by **Flamemaster Aranthir**, one of two people aware of its location, the other being **Zoltar the Defiler**.

If the investigation is conducted quickly, without giving **Zoltar** time to prepare, these items will reveal his nefarious goals. However, if the investigation is delayed, Zoltar may have the chance to hide or plant the evidence in someone else's quarters.

#### Confrontation with Zoltar

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Archmage** *(SRD, p.375)*

##### Tactics:
In addition to the usual spells on Archmage's spell list, he has access to: *Vampiric Touch*, *Bestow Curse*, *Phantasmal Killer*, and *Create Undead*.

##### Treasure:
A *Scroll of Dark Binding* (a wizard  spell).
}}

{{letter,note
#### Dark Binding
*5th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time:** :: 1 action
**Range:**        :: 60 ft
**Components:**   :: V,M ()
**Duration:**     :: Until dispelled.

You cast a powerful binding spell on a creature within range. The creature must make a **Charisma** saving throw or become corrupted by the dark flame. When under the spell's influence, the creature is consumed by dark flames, causing 6 (1d10) necrotic damage to both itself and any creature it touches on a given turn (which can be applied once per turn). 

As an action, you can issue a command that doesn't directly harm the creature. The creature can make an additional **Wisdom** saving throw to resist the command. On a successful save, the spell ends. On a failed save, the creature must obey the command or suffer 11 (2d10) psychic damage. 

The psychic damage increases by 1d10 per each spell level above 5th.

\page

Finding the culprit will not only earn the gratitude of **Flamemaster Aranthir** but also the respect of the entire Monastery of the Arcane Flame. As a token of their appreciation, they will grant the party a key to the **Pyramid of the Ancients**.

### Corrupt Phoenix
The phoenix that **Zoltar the Defiler** bound with dark magic is a fearsome beast, revered by the people of the monastery for many years. It makes its nest atop a towering cliff, located six miles away from the grand structure. Should the party draw near, the creature will not hesitate to attack with unbridled ferocity, using all of its formidable strength and abilities to defend its territory.

#### Valley of Skulls

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Corrupt Phoenix** *(SotP, p.141)*

##### Tactics:
The corrupt phoenix makes use of its flyby ability, remaining in the air as long as possible. Whenever a group of creatures gathers close together, he would rather avoid diving in, and rather use its Darkfire Convocation.
}}

When the **Corrupt Phoenix** is reduced to 0 hit points, it erupts in a burst of golden flames and disappears, only to be quickly reborn. Scholars at the Monastery suspect that this is due to the creature's powerful life force and connection to the elemental planes. However, if a creature casts *Remove Curse*, *Greater Restoration*, or *Wish* on the **Corrupt Phoenix** at any point, it is cleansed of the dark magic that has corrupted it. The phoenix is engulfed briefly in hot, golden-red flames as the magic is purged from its body, and it emerges free of its bindings and grateful to its liberators.

After being freed from the dark magic, the phoenix will express its gratitude to the party, speaking telepathically in a soothing and melodic voice. The phoenix will promise to return the favor if the party ever needs its help. Later in the adventure, the party might find themselves in need of one of the phoenix's feathers for a magical ritual, and the creature will gladly offer one without hesitation.

Another way the creature can repay the party is by coming to their aid in a dire situation. If the party is ever in a difficult fight outdoors, and the situation seems hopeless, the phoenix may appear in a sudden burst of golden flames to help. The bird will fight alongside the party, using its powerful fire magic to turn the tide of the battle. Once the fight is over, the phoenix will offer to heal the party's wounds, and even use its restorative powers to bring the fallen back to life.

### Pyramid of the Ancients
Given the directions to the ruined creation of the Old Ones, as well as a **Key to the Seal** upon it (a gray stone with shining light-blue runes on its surface), the grand entrance to the Pyramid of the Ancients stands open before the party.

The construction is huge, even if partially buried beneath the dunes. Below a layer of sandstone - if someone were to try and enter the pyramid by destroying it instead of entering through the main door - he would find a 5 feet thick, smooth layer of steel. It seems as if the entire inner construction had been made from one piece of metal, however impossible that would seem, but - after all - the Precursors were able to perform miracles of similar magnitude, at least in the legends.]

#### The Nave
Behind a set of stone doors, which will open to the adventurers upon touching them with the key they have received - or taken - from **Arathir**, will reveal the main nave of this ancient tomb. It is incredibly ornate, and well-preserved, especially considering  how old it is. The entire room is 100 feet long, and 30 feet wide, though there are two rows of columns on each side of the nave, which can provide cover.

Near the entrance, on the left wall there are doors leading to the side tunnels, which twist in a maze-like fashion; On the right, there are two sets of doors: the first leads to the burial chamber, the other, leads past a chamber holding a Ravenous Hunter to the further parts of the dungeon.

On the opposite side of the entrance, a stairway leads right up ahead into a small, 15 by 15 ft. room in which a fake sarcophagus had been placed, surrounded by treasure.

* 2x **Embergheist** *(SotP, p.133)*
* 4x **Ghoul** *(SRD, p.311)*
* 4x **Skeleton** *(SRD, p.246)*

##### Tactics:
The ghouls and skeletons provide a shieldwall to protect the embergheists in the back.

##### Environmental Hazards:
There are transepts on both sides of the room, which provide total cover for the embergheists, which can fling spells from there with relative safety.

##### Treasure:
One of the inanimate skeletons in this room grasps a *Shortsword of Sacred Scripture*.

\page

#### Maze Entrance
The entrance to the maze is an imposing sight, with massive double doors made of sandstone and secured from the inside with a sturdy metal bar. Opening these doors requires a skilled hand with **DC 30 Dexterity (Thieve's Tools)** or great physical strength. The lock is a challenge for those with the appropriate tools, while those relying on brute strength will need to succeed at a **DC 30 Strength (Athletics)** check. Otherwise, the doors can be unlocked with the key from **Flamemaster Aranthil**.

Once the doors are opened, the party finds themselves in a labyrinthine network of narrow corridors. The darkness is pervasive, and the walls are adorned with sinister glyphs and carvings. Although many smaller undead creatures inhabit these passageways, such as lone skeletons and the occasional pair of animated rats, most of them will flee at the slightest hint of the party's presence.

The first significant challenge in the maze is a pair of **Vampire Spawns** lurking in the center of the labyrinth. These deadly undead are not to be taken lightly and will undoubtedly pose a serious threat to the party.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Vampire Spawn** *(SRD, p.354)*

##### Tactics:
The Vampire Spawns hang from the high ceiling, waiting for the party to get close. When they hear the party, one of them casts *Darkness* spell on a trinket held by the other, and then attack.
}}

#### Steel Obelisk in the Maze
In the northernmost part of the maze, at the furthest distance from the entrance, lies the lair of a cunning **vampire**. The room is dimly lit by a few flickering candles, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The vampire is usually resting in his coffin, hidden behind a heavy curtain. However, if he detects intruders, he will quickly rise and close the hidden door leading to his lair, before embarking on a deadly hunt for his prey.

To reveal the secret passage leading to the vampire's lair, the party must make a **DC 19 Wisdom (Perception)** check. However, if they have already tracked the vampire to this location in his mist form, the check's DC is reduced by 5.

At the center of the room stands a towering steel obelisk, radiating a powerful aura that protects the pyramid. Destroying it reveals a well 50 feet deep, which turns to the east, to meet with another tunnel, with smooth, metallic walls, leading 500 feet down - the lift tunnel of **'VCI Fury'**.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Vampire** *(SRD, p.352)*

##### Tactics:
After being defeated, the vampire returns to the coffin in this room, and so he will fight fiercely to repel the party from it.

##### Treasure:
The Vampire wields a *Wand of Magic Missiles*
}}

#### Burial Chamber
On the right-hand side of the main nave lies a set of double doors that are now wide open, held in place by broken hangers that once held a metal rod to bar entrance. The doors lead to a narrow and low tunnel, measuring 50 feet in length, 5 feet in width, and 5 feet in height. The tunnel takes a right turn, and as it opens up, it leads to an unlit burial chamber.

At the corner of the tunnel, lies a dangerous fall trap that can be detected with a successful **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check. A character with proficiency in Thieve's Tools can then disarm the trap with a successful **DC 18 Dexterity (Thieve's Tools)** check. Failing this check by 5 or more will activate the trap.

When triggered, the trap will cause the floor to collapse, sending anyone in the tunnel falling 20 feet onto 2d4 spikes. Each spike deals 2d6 damage. Any creature in the tunnel can choose to make either a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw or a **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check. On a successful roll, the creature will manage to avoid the fall and either escape the corridor or lock itself between the walls.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Wraith** *(SRD, p.355)*
* 4x **Ogre Zombie** *(SRD, p.357)*

##### Tactics:
Wraiths surround themselves with the ogre zombies, so that they are better protected against focused attacks.

##### Environmental Hazard:
In this room, there are 4 columns, each with 10 HP and 12 AC. Destroying 2 or more of them collapses the room instantly, dealing 20d6 bludgeoning damage to every creature in the room.

##### Treasure:
There is a *+2 Spear* stuck in the wall, which either of the wraiths can pick up.

#### Ominous Whispers
The second corridor in the main nave leads to a smaller room on the right, which contains an altar. The air around them is filled with a palpable sense of dread, and the stench of death and decay permeates the room.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Ravenous Hunger** *(SotP, p142)*

##### Tactics:
The Ravenous Hunger awaits the party, in hopes that his unholy aura will dispose of them. Additionally, it will try to prevent the party from opening the door, so that the unholy effect of their presence lasts as long as possible.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The tunnel to the side chamber is very narrow, making it hard to pass through quickly.

##### Treasure
On a small altair behind this aberration, there is a *Halberd of Light*.
}}

While disposing of this monster may not be necessary, it can potentially make the party's journey through the guardian chambers easier if they do. Leaving the Ravenous Hunger may result in them alerting the guardians to the party's presence, leading to a more challenging battle.

#### Guardian Rooms
The rough-hewn sandstone walls and floor of the room lend an ancient and rugged atmosphere, illuminated dimly by flickering torchlight. The undead guards, standing motionless in the shadows, seem to take no notice of the party's entrance.

At the far end of the room, towering double doors bear intricate metallic adornments. Strange depictions cover the surface: some depict fierce birds of prey, their features rendered almost unrecognizable. Others show humanoid figures in bizarre attire, sporting metallic appendages such as extra arms and multiple eye sockets.

At the center of the doors, a human figure stands atop a platform of some sort, as if ascending into the heavens. Its purpose remains a mystery, but the craftsmanship is unmistakable: every detail is finely wrought, and the metal gleams in the flickering torchlight.

Behind the stone gates in this room, there is an entrance to the airlock.

##### Tactics:
Skeletal mages try to gather around a character that will be targeted by the spellcaster's Hold Person spell, and prepare their attacks until after the spell is cast (regardless of the result).

##### Treasure
All 5 the Wights carry *+1 Longswords*, which they use during the encounter.
}}

#### Airlock
The circular room is surprisingly spacious, with smooth metal walls that reflect any light that enters the room. In the center of the room, there is a platform that resembles the one depicted on the ornate doors outside. The platform seems to be the only way forward, but the floorboards are misaligned, blocking the passage.

{{letter,weird,note

##### The Riddle:

To open the doors, one must solve a riddle inscribed on the walls. The riddle reads: "I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch will soon turn red. What am I?" The answer is "fire", which when spoken aloud, causes the floorboards to shift and align, unlocking the doors.
}}

However, the room is not empty, as a powerful undead guardian, a Mummy Lord, awakens from its slumber to defend the airlock. It attacks immediately, with its rotting limbs and deadly curses.

* 1x **Mummy Lord** *(SRD, p.334)*

When the riddle is solved and the doors are unlocked, the platform lowers itself down, leading through a long, metal slide that descends hundreds of feet, leading to "VCI FURY" - a massive spacecraft of the ones that are now called The Precursors.

### VCI 'FURY'
Beneath the sandy surface lies a metallic structure, an ancient vehicle of the Precursors. Its interior is remarkably well-preserved, with control panels and screens still hovering nearby. Although the screens only display white light now, their former colors still burned into their screens.

Most of the rooms are spacious, towering 15 feet high, and the doors open automatically when any creature comes within 5 feet of them. They smoothly close as the creature moves to the other side or retreats. The rooms are illuminated by floor lights, but their dim glow only reaches the periphery, leaving the center of each room in darkness.

#### The Lift
The elevator is a grandiose sight to behold, with walls adorned in ancient hieroglyphs etched in intricate detail. It can be operated by old-fashioned levers and pulleys or by a high-tech, glowing platform powered by magic or futuristic technology. 

The elevator is crafted from an exotic material reminiscent of precious metals like electrum or adamantium, and its surface is decorated with a plethora of intricate carvings and symbols. After a minute-long descent, the blast doors open, revealing a stairway leading down to the next room of the ship.

####  Boarding Corridor
Beyond the formidable blast doors, stands the first guardian of this ancient place, left behind by the precursors. As the adventurers approach, the guardian's sensors fail to recognize them as friendly and it springs into action, unleashing a fierce attack upon the intruders.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Elite Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.166)*

##### Tactics:
The Elite Precursor Armor attacks on sight, though it steps down, if the intruders express the will to leave, and follow through on it.
}}

\column

#### Main Deck
Once the pulsing heart of the spacecraft, now it lies silent and dark. Only a solitary blue light flickers intermittently, scanning the immediate area. Despite the dimness, five humanoid figures can be discerned, standing just outside the door.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 5x **Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*

##### Tactics:
The mechs are dormant at first, unless the Elite Armor from the previous corridor had alarmed them of the approaching danger. For the purpose of game mechanics, assume they are asleep.
}}

The main deck of the ship serves as a vital communication hub. Six pairs of blast doors line the walls, each leading to a distinct section of the vessel.

#### Armory
Similar to the captain's quarters and engine control room, the armory is securely locked. However, there is no conventional keyhole, and gaining entry requires the use of magic. A *knock* spell might suffice, or the master key stored in the war room located in the left wing of VCI'FURY'.

Inside, there is a trove of artifacts of old:

{{descriptive
##### Treasure:
* Four sets of metallic armor, of an ancient design - *Precursor Skafanders*. They are equivalent to *Adamantine Plate Armor*.

* A *Ring of Force Resistance*.

* A set of *+2 Tinkerer's Tools*

* A *Precursor Sword*
}}

#### Left Wing
The short corridor stretches ahead, dimly illuminated by the flickering, crimson glow emanating from the floor lights. Despite the subdued lighting, the figures of numerous guardians stationed along the passageway are clearly visible. These formidable sentinels, remnants of the Precursors' advanced technology, stand watch, their piercing eyes scanning for any potential threats to their domain. The guardians' sleek metallic forms glisten in the muted light, and the low hum of their power

sources echoes through the air. It is clear that any who seek to pass through this corridor will face a formidable challenge.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*
* 3x **Elite Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.166)*

##### Tactics:
The guardians are active and will do all they can to repel the intruders.
}}

The area is punctuated by two imposing sets of doors, each leading to a distinct section of the ship. The first pair of doors leads to the forward section, where the War Room lies in wait. The second set of doors leads to the aft section, where the crew's living quarters are located.

#### Dormitory
As the party steps into the spaceship dormitory, the sense of abandonment is palpable. The room is eerily quiet, and dust covers almost every surface, indicating that it has been abandoned for thousands of years. The double-decker beds that once occupied the space are still present, though they are now in a state of disrepair, with their metal frames rusted and creaky.

The once soft, nice-to-touch carpet has long since worn away, leaving only a rough and scratchy surface beneath your feet. The lockers and drawers that once provided storage for the crew's personal belongings now stand empty, their contents long since removed or lost to time.

Despite the neglect, the room still bears traces of the lives that were once lived here. Faded posters and pictures of loved ones still hang on the walls, providing a glimpse into the personalities of the crew that once called this place home. The reading lamps still affixed to the walls, though non-functional, serve as a testament to the crew's desire for comfort and familiarity in the midst of their isolated and treacherous surroundings.

{{note
As you explore the room, you can't help but wonder what led to the abandonment of this once thriving spaceship. The answers remain shrouded in mystery, lost to the sands of time, but the sense of loss and abandonment that permeates the dormitory serves as a reminder of the fragility of even the most advanced technologies and the fleeting nature of human existence.
}}

#### War Command Room
In the middle of the room, there is an imposing steel table, stretching almost the entire length of the room, and it is flanked by ten metal chairs, arranged in a neat and orderly fashion around its perimeter. 

The chairs are now covered in a thick layer of dust, and the once polished metal has become dulled and corroded with age.

The layout of the table and chairs brings to mind the image of a modern council chamber, but the state of disrepair makes it clear that this room has not seen use for a very long time. The table's surface is pitted and scarred, and you can see the outlines of old stains, hinting at the many meals and meetings that were once held here.

{{note
As you approach the table, your eyes are drawn to a small, flat object that rests in the center of its surface. It is a master key, crafted from the same metal as the table and chairs, and it gleams dully in the dim light. The key is a powerful symbol of the ship's authority, granting access to all the rooms on the vessel.
}}

#### Captain's Room
The commander's room of this craft is currently locked and cannot be opened with a set of thief's tools. However, it can be opened with a Knock spell. Alternatively, entry can be gained with an access card, which can be located on top of the desk in the War Command Room.

Once inside, a luxurious bed, an empty aquarium with a bit of dust on the bottom, a wardrobe containing strange clothes, and a cabinet with a collection of coins consisting of 126 platinum pieces and 253 electrum can be found.

#### The Bridge
The front part of the ship is accessed through a short corridor. Upon arrival, a cramped room is encountered, featuring some blinking lights and two comfortable chairs made of an unknown material. Numerous flat screens can be observed throughout the space fighter bridge, their displays burned out with light from years of use. The screens have been utilized for a variety of functions, ranging from navigational data and system diagnostics to communications and weapons control. Despite their apparent age and wear, it is clear that they were once vital tools for the operation of the spacecraft.

#### Right Wing
The floor of the hall linking various rooms to the facilities situated in the right wing is illuminated by red lights. Access to both the front and back of VCI 'FURY' is provided by two sets of blast doors, with the former leading to the hangar and the latter granting entry to the engine control.

#### Hangar
Within the mostly empty and spacious room, there exists only a machine of great power that had previously served the precursors, having been deployed from and maintained within this very room.

Currently, the machine remains dormant, awaiting further instructions.

* 1x **Helio Tank** *(SotP, p.163)*

##### Tactics:
The tank is slightly damaged. Reduce its AC to 22 and HP to 350. It only activates after being attacked.
}}

There are only a few flickering lights illuminating the vast expanse. Rows of rusted and inactive weapons are hung along the walls, serving as a testament to the long-forgotten battles they once engaged in. The air is musty and stale, suggesting that it has been quite some time since anyone set foot within the hangar. Despite the silence and emptiness that pervades the space, there remains a sense of latent power and potential, as if the ship could spring to life at any moment and take to the stars once again.

#### Engine Control
Similar to the captain's quarters, access to the Engine Control room is restricted and requires the use of a master key, which is located in the War Command Room situated at the front of the left wing of this abandoned ship.

A successful **DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)** check will be able to detect the sound of metal colliding behind the thick blast doors, an unmistakable indication that active guardians are present within the room.

}}

Towards the back of the room, a faint light illuminates a strange device, which serves as the repository for the coveted Power Cell. The device's original purpose remains unknown, but unmistakably, this is the item they have arrived in search of. The remainder of the room is barren, with no obvious signs of recent activity.

{{note,letter
After recovering the Power Cell, the battery that can power the machinery in Icarus Control Center, there remains little to do in this place, and so the party should make it's preparations to return back to the Eastern Desert, and investigate the issues in the Tomb of the Precursors, now that they can power up the complex.

As the party securely returns the power cell to the chambers of the Tomb of the Precursors, they are provided with detailed instructions on how to integrate it into the intricate machinery within the complex. Although several of the facility's functions have been successfully restored, certain critical elements remain dormant, notably the imposing blast doors that safeguard access to the AI Core. **ICCAI** emphasizes the essential nature of accessing its core for the mission of saving the world, and while there is some truth to this claim, there is more to the story. While the world is indeed under threat, **Grisseaux** has ulterior motives, seeking to exploit the full potential of the Forge of Guardians to return to his own realm. Yet, such an act would disrupt the protective barriers established by the precursors, leading to a surge of demons into Antarriah. The AI, primarily driven by self-preservation, is determined to reset its default settings to avert this dire outcome.

**ICCAI** now grants access to additional sections of the complex to provide enhanced amenities for the party:

- **Kitchen**: This area produces a sustenance substance known as *nourishing sludge*, which, while not visually appealing, is rich in calories and serves as a vital food source.
- **Workshop**: A secure repository for the party's expanding collection of treasures, housing valuable items crafted by the Precursors, including a *Pearl of Power*, a *Ring of Spell Storing*, and a *Precursor Shield*.
- **Ambulatory**: In this space, the party can undergo complete healing and, if necessary, receive replacement appendages.

Upon conducting a comprehensive facility scan, **ICCAI** pinpoints the root cause of the problem: a missing power cord that is impeding energy distribution. Although a replacement could potentially be fabricated, the technological capabilities in this world do not meet the required standards. Instead, a cord crafted by the very creators of the AI is imperative. Fortunately, **ICCAI** can trace the whereabouts of such a cord to the tower belonging to the renowned archmage Hasedoki, famed for his mastery of thunder and lightning magic. The AI strongly urges the party to embark on a quest to locate this mage and seek his assistance, even proposing that acquiring his staff through any means necessary could be considered as an alternative should he refuse.

Moreover, the AI advises the party to inquire about the precise whereabouts of the Tower within the Order of the Holy Blood, a nearby religious order. According to **ICCAI**, this group maintains an amicable relationship with the archmage and possesses the key to his tower, given as a symbol of trust for some favor.

{{letter,note
Unbeknownst to the party, the Order of the Holy Blood secretly venerates the precursors, regarding them as the true gods based on ancient beliefs. However, the organization remains unaware of the beings' actual origin.
:
Presently, the abbey lies in ruins due to an ill-fated experiment by the order's leader, a bloodmage named **Thalnos**. He sought to transform himself into a precursor by using the Holy Blood, resulting in a disastrous failure that corrupted the order's knights. These once-noble warriors now wander as dark echoes of their former selves.
}}

### Road to Monastery
Located on the fringes of a desert, the secluded monastery is relatively accessible. Caravans transporting essential supplies visit every two months, providing the Order of the Holy Blood with necessities they can't produce themselves. Most of these caravans originate from Clearcoast, a bustling trading hub.
:
On the road to the Abbey, present the party with one of these random encounters:
:
##### Encounter on the way
| D6. | Encounter |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| 1-2                 | The party encounters a caravan traveling eastward across the continent. The merchants tell of strange darkness that propagated a couple of nights before from the desert.     |
| 3-4                 | 6d4 **Giant Scorpions** burrowed in the ground on the way to attack the party during one of the rests on the way!     |
| 5-6                 | While crossing the desert the party sees what appears to be an oasis in the distance. As they approach, the oasis vanishes into a mirage, leaving the party disoriented and dehydrated.     |

### The Abbey
#### Entrance Hall
The Entrance Hall serves as the first point of contact for the party upon entering the Monastery. Characterized by grandeur, the space boasts high ceilings, marble walls and floors, and imposing pillars that support the roof. Illuminated by wall-mounted torches, the hall features a massive wooden door at its end, leading deeper into the Monastery. Towering marble statues of the Knights of the Holy Blood flank both sides of the hall, emitting an aura of vigilant protection. The air carries the fragrance of incense and the gentle crackling of torch flames.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Knight of the Holy Blood** *(SotP, p.143)*

##### Tactics:
The Knights adeptly employ shield wall tactics and prefer close formations.
}}

#### Courtyard
The Courtyard is a large open-air space within the Monastery of the Order of the Holy Blood. The walls of the Monastery enclose the courtyard, giving it the feeling of a private garden. The ground is made of finely cut stone, with a circular fountain in the center, surrounded by a bed of colorful flowers and plants. There are several statues of the Precursors scattered around the courtyard, each one of them depicting the Precursors in different poses and expressions. The statues are made of marble, and they are of impressive size. The courtyard is well-maintained, and it is evident that the Order takes great care in preserving it. In the corners of the courtyard, there are arches that lead to other parts of the monastery.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:

#### Meadhall
The Meadhall is a large and imposing room, designed for dining and socializing, with a large fireplace at one end and long tables and chairs scattered throughout. The walls are made of stone, and covered in blood, which is smeared and splattered in different patterns and designs, giving the room a macabre and unsettling feel. Wooden

floor creaks underfoot. The room is dimly lit by torches placed along the walls, casting a flickering light on  the blood-covered walls. At the head of the tables sits a large throne-like chair, likely used by the leader of the Order. The room is filled with the smell of burnt wood from the fireplace and the coppery smell of blood.

}}

#### Common Room
Once serving as a shared living space for the members of the Order, with rows of bunk beds lining the walls, this room is far from its former glory. The beds are simple, with plain mattresses and thin blankets. Stone walls have several small windows that let in natural light. The room is dimly lit by torches placed along the walls. There are several small tables and chairs scattered throughout the room. The air is musty and damp, with a smell of damp stone and old wood.

The Bloodspawn lie in ambush, waiting for all of the adventurers to enter at least 10 feet into the room.

#### The Chapel
Once a place for the knights of the order to gather and worship their gods, the entire building seems to bleed from the slits in the wall. Covered with thick, red liquid, the building is eerie to even gaze upon.
Bloodmage **Thalnos**, who attempted to use the Precursor's Blood to transcend mortality had failed, and it is his fault that the knights of the order became corrupted.

# Staff of Power
}}

### The Tower
Going through the Tower, from the lowest level to the highest might take the adventurers some time, especially considering that most of the levels have some sort of security mechanisms against unannounced visitors.
Hasedoki's Tower is a marvel to look upon - this square building, approximately 30ft by 30ft on the outside measures just over 360 ft.. The wizard tower has 24 levels, each connected by a set of stairs. Each room is about 15ft high, and 25ft. by 25ft. inside; and none of the rooms have windows, unless otherwise stated. 

#### 1st Floor - Entrance
The first floor of the Tower is rather unimpressive; the floor is made of fine oak planks, and there is some simple furniture for storage, containing a couple of simple outfits and uninspired travel robes.

Upon one of the desks, on a magically lit purple light, there is a single *Potion of Healing*.

#### 2nd Floor - Crystal Room
A level higher, the room is made as if it was carved in a smooth, black stone. On the floor, there are stains of blood, possible to notice only with a source of light, as they aren't noticeable on the black stone.

On stone pedestals, there are also three crystals, pulsing with inner light: yellow, cyan, and violet, however they do not light the room. They are permanently attached to the pedestals, and cannot be removed.

Touching a crystal causes a surge of magic to be released from within, casting a spell on the creature that touched them. Detect Magic reveals strands of magic corresponding to the school of magic these spells originate from, and a successful **DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana)** check allows to identify the spell that the crystal would cast.

|Crystal          |       Effect       | 
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Yellow Crystal  | Light, 1 hour      |
| Cyan Crystal    | Fly, 10 minutes    |
| Violet Crystal  | Darkvision, 1 hour |

#### 3rd Floor - Library
This room filled to the brim with bookcases and books scattered around is a inhabited by a **Watcher**, enslaved by **Hasedoki** with a powerful Geas spell, forcing him to defend the tower against intruders - which just happens to include the party, no matter if they try to appear non-hostile.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Watcher** *(SotP, p.149)*

##### Environmental Hazards:
The bookcases in this room can be knocked over, creating a difficult terrain for creatures that cannot fly.

##### Treasure:
Amongst the tomes, if searched for, some unique books can be found. They are worth 300gp total.
}}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#### 4th Floor - Study Room
Inside the study, there is a large cage, which holds a particularly big Giant Coral Snake, held here by Hasedoki to extract his venom. The animal is lethargic, and even when the cage is opened, does not attack, unless directly harmed. 

Upon the table, there are alchemical apparatus and a couple of vials of venom - 3 vials of Serpent venom, and one vial of Purple Worm poison.

#### 5th Floor - Conjuration Room
The walls of this room are faintly lit by 5 runes in the middle of the room, which flicker aggressively. The light has a tint of pink, and the closer to the runes, the stronger the smell of ozone becomes.

The runes are maintaining a protective spell put upon a **Rakshasa**, binding it to this place, forcing him to speak only truth, with no freedom to manipulate the questioner; however, the spells are too weak to maintain themselves for too long; after answering three questions truthfully, the imprisoned **Rakshasa** can manipulate the questioner with his answer to the fourth question, straight-up lie in answer to the fifth, and is freed at the very moment of being asked sixth.

##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Rakshasa** *(SRD, p.341)*

##### Tactics:
The fiend does not wish to prolong his stay in the tower, and so it uses Plane Shift to escape  whenever it is less than sure of himself. Before that, it uses its claw attacks to curse as many of the PC's as possible.
}}

{{note
##### What does the Rakshasa know?

Although a prisoner for not a long time, the Rakshasa has some knowledge of the Tower, and even Hasedoki himself:

*  There are 24 floors total. In some, there are guardians, in some - traps, others contain riddles.
:
* The riddle on the next floor is simple - just take two candles from that room, tie the unlit candle with two strings, or scorch more shapes on the floor.
:
* Hasedoki indeed has recently obtained an item matching the description of the ***Power Cord***. Hasedoki calls it a Staff of Power, and it just so happens it is currently on the 24th level of the Tower.
:
* The wizard that lives here rarely visits. It is entirely possible that the party could wait months, and not meet the owner.

The **Rakshasa** can also be freed by breaking one or more of the runes on the floorboard. Simply stepping on them is not enough, but wedging a knife between the floorboards is.

Attacking the **Rakshasa** also breaks the spell, causing the runes to explode with booming energy. Each creature in the room, excluding the fiend, have to make a **DC 20 Constitution** saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute, and they can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.

#### 6th Floor - Planetarium
In the middle of the room, there is a beautiful model of a star system, around which many glowing spheres circulate. While most of them do not present much value, being only animated by the central mechanisms, two of them glow with slightly more powerful light.

As the spectacle is distracting, the party might find themselves ambushed by the creatures lurking in the shadows, - two cloakers, disguised as coats hanging on hangers in the corners of the room.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x Cloaker *(SRD, p.268)*

##### Tactics:
The cloakers wait in the shadows, trying to ambush the party.

##### Treasure:
Two of the glowing spheres, which levitate around the central mechanisms can be taken. The trinkets were once inscribed, but the letters are lost to time
}}

The first of the spheres, glowing with dark, red light, brings an unpleasant sensation to the person who touches it.

The spheres, while not cursed, come with a drawback - a person carrying either one cannot hide from aberrations - in case of the red one; or devils - in case of the cyan one - as they are supernaturally visible for those creatures due to the origin of their magic.

#### 7th Floor - Candle-Lit Room
On the wooden floor of this room, dimly lit by eleven candles, there are four triangles, scorched into the floor, as if the flame traveled by a line of black powder, destroying the planks. There is one candle, unlit, hanging by five silver threads to the ceiling.

Contrary to other rooms, there seems to be no stairs up; but they descend from the ceiling if the riddle is solved.

{{note
##### The Riddle
There are ***Four*** triangles, inside of which there are  ***Eleven*** lit candles, and ***One*** unlit candle, hanged upon ***Five*** silver strings.

In essence, the riddle calls for scorching three additional triangles on the floor of the room, for the number of the candles total (***Twelve*** total) with the number of things 'holding' them - (***Nine*** total). It is also possible to remove the candles from the room, to match the things that can hold the candle.

}}

When the stairs fall down, faint blue light can be perceived through the hole, from the 8th level of the Tower.

#### 8th Floor - Crystal Study
Reminiscent of the second floor of the Tower, the walls and the ceiling of this room is a smooth, black stone; however the floor is made of oak planks, and there is a large, dusty rug near the wall. In one of the corners, there is a large, dimly shimmering, cyan crystal.

Upon touching the second of the spheres, which glows with cold, blue light, harmless hoarfrost covers the hand of the creature wielding the item.

Characters with passive perception 15 or greater can notice stains of black, thick liquid on the floor, which clues them about the **Black Puddings**, tightly sticking to the ceiling.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Black Pudding** *(SotP, p.337)*

##### Tactics:
The Puddings fall from the ceiling on the adventurers entering the room, dealing 3d6 damage on the fall, half on a successful **DC 12 Dexterity** Saving Throw.

##### Treasure:
There is a *+1 Plate Armor* inside one of the Black Puddings.
}}

The crystal, upon closer inspection, seems to be of the same material that the party might have encountered before, amongst the remains of the Old Machines, but larger.

#### 9th Floor - Arcane Study
There is only one, massive birch table in the middle of this room, but it is filled to the brim with notes, small quartz crystals, mechanical parts of the Old Machines, skulls of large animals and monstrosities, as well as two *Greater Potions of Healing* and *Hasedoki's Spare Spellbook*.

#### 10th Floor - The Pink Room
As opposed to the previous floors of the Tower, this place is pleasant. Smell of roses and expensive perfumes fills the room, the floors of which are covered with thick, fluffy textilia. The walls of the room are painted bright pink, meanwhile the ceiling seems to be a silver mirror.

There are two Succubi and one Incubus in this room, shifted into the form of beautiful - and completely naked - elves. They are bound by **Hasedoki** to guard the entrance to the upper floors. They are bored, and so they want to trick the party into kissing them, for granting the party a key.

The demons try their hardest to perform their Draining Kiss.

##### Treasure:
There is a *Philter of Love* upon one of the tables. One of the Succubi has the key to the upper floor.
}}

#### 11th Floor - Purple-Flame Room
Inside this room, in the very center, there is a purple flame, roaring with heat. Around the bonfire, four crystal balls  are anchored into the stone floor. Upon inspecting the fire, a character will begin to hear a voice, and see shadowy figures inside the flame.

If they choose to investigate further, have them roll a **DC 14 Wisdom** Saving throw. On a failure, the visions are an incoherent mess, and the character takes 3d6 psychic damage.

On a successful, the character experiences a vision through the flames. They are directed upon the 16th floor of the tower, the room filled with mimics disguised as chests. Because there is no one physically present in the room, and the creatures are not aware of being spied on, a longer look is enough to reveal that some of the mimics change their position, perhaps to a one they see more alluring to a tasty adventurer.

#### 12th Floor - Chamber of Fire
If looked carefully from below, six brightly burning candles are placed in a large circle, around a fire symbol in the middle. Upon entering, six living flames (Fire Elementals, but reduced to a Tiny size) fly up from the candles, and attack the party

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 6x **Fire Elemental** (tiny) *(SotP, p.306)*
* 1x **Fiery Guardian** *(SotP, p.146)*

##### Tactics:
Fiery Guardian appears only after all 6 fire elementals are defeated. They all focus on the closest enemy.

##### Treasure:
3 *Scrolls of Conjure Elemental* can be easily found in the corner of the room, tied with a red ribbon.
}}

Otherwise, the 12th floor of the tower is empty, however there is a window facing north. It is 3ft by 2ft, and barred with iron, but it still provides the room with fresh air, and a tremendous sight over the desert upon which the tower had been built.

::::::::::::::::::::::

#### 13th Floor - The Blue Room
This floor of the Tower is filled with a soft, blue light, which seems to come from nowhere in particular. The walls and floor are made of smooth, polished wood, and there is a blue carpet in the middle of the room.

In the center of the room, there are two levitating lamps, which hover just above the ground. The lamps give off a warm, golden light that fills the room with a cozy glow.

It seems as though this room is used as a place for relaxation and contemplation. The soft light and comfortable furnishings make it a peaceful and welcoming space. 

#### 14th Floor - The Hunting Lodge
This floor of the Tower has the feel of a hunting lodge, with rough stone walls and a dirt floor. The room is filled with the smell of pine and wood smoke, and there is a large fireplace on one wall. The hearth is cold and empty, but the ashes within suggest that it is often used.

In the center of the room, there is a large bear fur on the floor, and scattered around it are several hunting trophies - the antlers of a stag, the skull of a boar, and the pelt of a wolf. There are also several weapons and tools hanging on the walls - a bow, a quiver of arrows, and a spear.

It seems as though this room is used as a place for Hasedoki and his apprentices to relax and plan their hunting expeditions.

#### 15th Floor - The Scene
This room looks like nothing other than a theater scene. Inside the pitch-black space, there is a pillar of blue spotlight, shining on a deranged elf, only speaking in rhyme and song.

Long time ago, **Hasedoki** encountered him during his travels, and found him amusing enough to accommodate it into his Tower, and since this poor soul is completely insane, he spits random facts or lies about his old homeland.

\column
:::::::::::

{{note
##### Theatrical Soul
You can - if you feel confident enough - encourage the players to play along with the insane Eladrin by having him play a major role in a theatrical performance that you and the players know - although it takes a lot of preparation on your side. Don't push the players to perfectly reenact particular roles in the play - perhaps they can find  a way to put the play to a better end than the original!
}}

#### 16th Floor - The Mimic Room
On the 16th floor, the way to the stairway upwards is blocked off by over a dozen heavy, dusted chests with iron reinforcements. Each of them has a large keyhole - and each of them happens to be a mimic.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 13x **Mimic** *(SRD, p.319)*

##### Tactics:
Whenever any of the mimics reveals itself one way or another, all  other mimics spring to an animated state, and fight. They fight to the death, as they are starved for fresh flesh.
}}

There does happen to be a treasure in the room - underneath one of the mimics there is a hidden stash, which can be perceived with a **DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)** check. It contains a *Wand of Magic Missiles*, a *Pearl of Power* and a *+1 Greataxe*.

#### 17th Floor - The Crypt
This floor of the Tower is cold and damp, with the smell of decay and mold filling the air. The walls and floor are made of rough, gray stone, and there are several stone sarcophagi scattered throughout the room. Each one is adorned with intricate carvings and symbols, and they seem to be very old.

Above each of the sarcophagi, there is a strange, glowing green crystal hovering on top of it. Each crystal gives off an eerie green light that seems to pulsate and shift.


#### 18th Floor - The Shrine of Selune
This floor of the Tower is dedicated to Selune, the elven goddess of the Moon. The room is filled with a bright, silvery light, and the walls and floor are made of smooth, white marble.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

In the center of the room, there is an altar dedicated to the moon goddess, which glows with an otherworldly light. The altar is adorned with symbols of the moon and stars, and there are several offerings laid out upon it - bowls of milk, silver coins, and pieces of jewelry. It seems as though this room is used as a place of worship and devotion, but careful investigation can reveal that it hadn't been visited in quite some time.

#### 19th Floor - Apprentice Dormitory
This room has 5 medium-sized beds. It is mostly dark, with a matte white crystal giving off dim light upon the center of the room. If it is night, the apprentices are asleep, if it's day - they sit on their beds, talking to each other, and practicing their Draconic.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Mercenary Mage** *(SotP, p.135)*
* 2x **Mercenary Apprentice** *(SotP, p.135)*

##### Tactics:
The Mages have Mage Armor cast on themselves. They are aware of how powerful magic can be, and so they use their reactions only to Counterspell, and they do so at every opportunity.

##### Treasure:
The mages have several scrolls amongst them; some of them include three *Scrolls of Fireball*, two *Scrolls of Wall of Fire*, two *Scroll of Flaming Arrow*, and a *Scroll of Summon Elemental*.
}}

#### 20th Floor - The Safe Room
At first glance, this floor of the Tower appears to be a safe and secure office, with a large wooden desk, a comfortable bed, and several shelves filled with books and scrolls. The room is warm and well-lit, and there is a feeling of safety and calm within.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
1x **Invisible Stalker** *(SRD, p.323)*

##### Tactics:
Invisible stalker, hanging on the ceiling, waiting for an opportunity to strike. It's waiting patiently for an unsuspecting victim to approach, at which point it will attack from hiding.

##### Treasure:
Inside the desk, there is a *Wand of the War Mage +1*, locked in a drawer with a hidden compartment. Opening it requires a successful **DC 24 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** proficiency check.
}}

#### 21st Floor - The Bone Room
This floor of the Tower is a gruesome sight, with bones scattered everywhere. The walls and floor are made of rough, stone blocks, and the room is dimly lit by flickering torches.

In the center of the room, there is a large pile of bones, arranged to resemble a humanoid. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the bones do not belong to a humanoid creature. The bones are disjointed and misshapen, and there are several strange, extra joints and bones that do not seem to belong to any known creature. On the floor, there is a large skull, placed upon a bed of bloodied boards. The skull has strange, glowing runes etched into its surface, and it seems to be pulsing with an otherworldly energy. It appears to be some sort of ritual or experimentation chamber. It is unclear what purpose the bones serve, or what the glowing runes on the skull signify. Disrupting the bones in any way provokes a group of demons to attack the party out of thin air.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Vroc** *(SRD, p.273)*
* 2x **Nightmare** *(SRD, p.320)*
* 1x **Glabrezu** *(SRD, p.271)*

##### Tactics:
The Demons do not appear simultaneously. At first, 2 Vrocs appear, then, at initiative count 0 of the second round of combat the Nightmares appear,until finally, at initiative count 0 of round four the Glabrezu appears.
}}

#### 22nd Floor - The Treasure Room
This floor of the Tower is a treasure trove of magical objects. The room is small and cramped, with shelves and chests overflowing with glittering jewels and ancient artifacts.

In the center of the room, there are three objects surrounded by a fiery red aura. The first object is a *Scroll of Fireball*. The second object is a *Scroll of Flame Strike*. The third object is a *Helmet of Fire Resistance*. 
The room is filled with the smell of smoke and ashes, and there is a feeling of danger and power emanating from the glowing objects. It is clear that these objects are powerful and potentially dangerous, and they should be handled with caution.

{{descriptive
##### Environmental Hazard:
The room is trapped with a Glyph of Warding. Whenever a creature touches one of the three magic items, it explodes, dealing 8d6 necrotic damage, halved on a successful **DC 21 Dexterity** saving throw.

}}

#### 23rd Floor - The Corpse Room
This floor of the Tower is a chaotic and dangerous place, filled with the energy of dark magic. The room is large and open, with several knocked over bookshelves and scattered papers covering the floor. In the center of the room, there is a bloodied corpse, half-buried under one of the bookshelves. It is clear that this person met a violent end, and there are signs of a struggle throughout the room.

#### 24th Floor - Hasedoki's Sanctum
The last story of the mage's tower might be a bit disappointing at a glance, as it could easily be mistaken for a peasant's house, with loose sacks of grain in the corners, a sleeping bag on the floor and a rusty bathtub near the southern wall.

On the walls  of the room, there are dozens, if not hundreds of drawings and paintings looking as if made by the hand of a child. Some of them depict Hasedoki himself, some - a mighty being of fire - a Phoenix.

In one of the corners of the room, an old human is standing, clutching the item the party is searching for  - it is the Old Archmage **Hasedoki**.

{{note
The old man that can be found in the highest level of the tower is looking bewildered onto different  corners of the room. His white hair and beard in a messy state, falling on richly decorated, and without a doubt magical robe. Around his head, a green crystal is orbiting slowly; and you can see the item that you seek - the arcane staff - clutched in his hands very tightly.
}}

The old mage is sick, or perhaps cursed with some terrible affliction, that dispels his attention, dulls his mind and senses, and makes it difficult for him to tell friend from foe; a lesser mind would surely succumb to this condition far quicker, and the archmage will inevitably suffer the same fate if he is not helped in time. Luckily for the party, his research into his condition, conducted before he reached his current sorry state, had reached a clear conclusion that the only cure possible in the reach of mortals is for a phoenix to touch **Hasedoki** with his wings. The archmage does remember his research, and is able to recall it in detail, but he isn't able to follow his own line of reasoning.

Though in a weakened state, Hasedoki is not to be underestimated, as his raw magical power, as well as vast trove of magical items make him a person not to be trifled with. He is wearing *Robe of the Archmagi*, wielding the *Staff of the Precursors*, and has attuned to an *Ioun Stone of Sustenance*.

\column

Paranoid as he is, the archmage will not attack the party unprovoked, in fact, he only turns hostile when damaged, or if an attempt to take the *Staff of the Precursors* away from him, including repeating efforts towards persuading him to give up the staff, and any attempt at deception.

When fighting in his tower, some of  the servants he had summoned previously, and sent off to search for a cure to his condition, may return to defend the wizard. In case of combat, on initiative count 20 roll a d20 to determine what servant will arrive:

| D20 Roll | Creature               |
|----------|------------------------|
| 1-5      | **Magma Mephit** with 1 HP *(SRD, p.323)*|
| 6-10     | **Magmin** *(SRD, p.329)*    |
| 11-15    | **Magma Mephit**  *(SRD, p.323)* |
| 16-19    | **Fire Elemental** *(SRD, p.306)*|
| 20       | **Fiery Guardian** *(SotP, p.146)*|

Creatures that arrive in this way appear in the closest unoccupied space near Hasedoki, and act on initiative count 1. They do their best to protect the old wizard, and disappear the instant **Hasedoki** dies.

{{letter,note
Archmage Hasedoki was once one of the most - if not the most  - powerful evokers to ever live; rivaling the power - but not the ambition - of Gilxed, the Dragon Emperor himself. Unfortunately, the health of Hasedoki has since degraded, just as the sharpness of his mind had gradually faded.
}}

To retrieve the *Staff of the Precursors*, which is required to repair the **ICCAI**, Hasedoki has to be defeated, or healed of his affliction -  he will then gratefully gift the party with the item as soon as he is asked to do so, grateful for help.

#### Restoring Hasedoki
The archmage can be healed only by a willing Phoenix, either in person or with a feather willingly given; or with the help of Wish spell, Divine Intervention, or other similarly powerful magic. In Antarriah, some Phoenixes are rarely seen at the deserts, but only the pure-hearted creatures ever gain a chance to talk with these celestial creatures.

## Chapter 15
# Tablet of the Precursors
}}

:
Once the Staff of Power, or more precisely, the power cord, is retrieved and installed according to **ICCAI's** instructions, the mechanical mind will be able to restore power to the entire complex. This unlocks the capability to construct new copies of the Old Machines, though it requires the collection of scraps that cannot be obtained elsewhere. As a general guideline, gathering scraps from 10 Old Machines of a given type will allow **ICCAI** to produce one new machine under the party's command. However, repairs can only be performed in the dedicated workshop and not in the field.

Now, as all of the doors are powered in the facility, **ICCAI** will regretfully inform the party that he is unable to locate **The Gray Man**, as it would require a manual instruction to his physical terminal, confirmed with an appropriate **Access Pass**. Unfortunately, the pass from Icarus Control Center had been taken by the madman, but a secret that **ICCAI** managed to keep from him that they were universal - and the AI knows just the place where another one can be found - at the east cove of Antarriah.

### Knife's Edge
Armed with a precise map, the party sets out with a clear goal ahead and a relatively safe road to travel. The journey to Port Ilaq can be completed through safe roads leading through the city of Sorsaler. From there, it shouldn't take much effort to reach the Knife's Edge - a cliff range at the ocean's edge that leads to the Cove of Swords, the destination marked on the map.

#### Ambush from the sky
As the party makes their way down a narrow road, less than half a mile away from the entrance to the caves they seek, a sudden screeching sound pierces the air. They look up to see three **Vrocs** descending upon them, ready to attack.

The sudden attack by the dangerous **Vrocs** is a foreboding sign. The fact that the creatures appeared without a summoner in sight suggests that the veil between worlds is already disturbed, and some demons have managed to enter the material realm. This ominous perspective should spur the party to proceed with caution and urgency. They must ensure they can stop the looming threat before it's too late and the second Abyssal invasion begins. Regardless, the party should be able to reach the cavern entrance in less than an hour from this ambush site.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Vroc** *(SRD, p.273)*

##### Tactics:
The demons attack  from the air, making use of their Stunning Screech ability one by one.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The cliffs are very narrow, and there is a 400 feet drop down, so creatures without the ability to fly should take extra care.

##### Treasure:
The Vrocs carry expensive jewelry: an amulet worth 400gp and three golden rings with jewels worth 100 gp each.

### Knife's Edge Caverns
The natural caverns that tunnel deep into the ground are extensive, but straightforward for the most part. Narrow corridors with low ceilings lead the way, and the walls occasionally tremble as one of the **gricks** living in the area passes by.

To ascertain the origin of the caverns, a successful **DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)** check is required. Through careful observation, the party will notice that the tunnels appear to have been dug out by a **grick** of unfathomable size, which is an unnerving thought. However, there is a silver lining: it appears that the caverns have not been traversed in quite some time, which means that the party may be the first to explore them in a while.

#### Traversing the cavern
If the party fails to take care in traveling silently, they risk alerting the numerous packs of **gricks** that dwell within the caverns. Any loud noises, heavy loads, or impactful steps could be enough to give away their position and invite an attack. The **gricks** are dangerous creatures, and a confrontation with them could be deadly. The party should proceed with caution, remaining aware of their surroundings and taking steps to minimize noise and disturbance.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Giant Grick** *(SotP, p.151)*
* 5x **Grick** *(SRD, p.318)*

##### Tactics:
Gricks maneuver to outflank their prey wherever possible. Whenever a character falls unconscious, they will try to grab them and drag them to the lair, where the body will be eaten.
}}

Traveling through the **Knife's Edge Caverns** is a challenging undertaking that takes a considerable amount of time. The journey is not overly complicated, but the constant sharp ascent or descent of the road can take a heavy toll on the characters, both physically and mentally. As the party presses on, they should be mindful of the potential dangers and take regular breaks to rest and recover their strength.

According to the map, there is a 3-mile-long path that will lead the party to an underground cove, which is their ultimate objective. However, the road is arduous, and every hour of travel takes its toll on the characters. To avoid succumbing to exhaustion, every character must make a **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check for each hour of travel. Failure to do so will result in gaining a level of exhaustion, which can severely hinder their ability to move and fight. Therefore, the party should plan their journey accordingly, taking enough rest and ensuring that they have enough provisions to sustain themselves.

### Cove of Swords
As the party arrives at the underground cove, they are met with a sight that takes their breath away. Ahead of them lies a massive blast door, surrounded by an ethereal glow of shimmering teal lights. The sheer size of the door is awe-inspiring, and its imposing presence suggests that whatever lies beyond is of great importance.

The teal lights surrounding the door pulsate in a rhythmic pattern, casting an otherworldly glow on the surrounding cavern walls. The air is thick with an electric energy, as if the very atmosphere is charged with anticipation. The party can sense that they are on the cusp of something significant, and the tension in the air is palpable.

{{letter,note
If the players have a preference for solving riddles, you can take advantage of this opportunity and present them with a puzzle of your own design, rather than having the party search for the keys.
}}

To unlock the blast door, the party needs three keys, each of which fits into one of three slits on the door. The keys are hidden nearby, but finding them won't be easy. For each hour of searching, have the party make **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Investigation)** checks, and add up the results. If their total score reaches 100 or higher, they find one of the keys. However, if they don't find a key during an hour, they must add the score they accumulated during that hour to the score they accumulate during the next hour.

### Sealed Complex
When the grand doors of the complex swing open, a dusty scent wafted in with the chilly breeze, offering a chilly welcome to the intrepid explorers. Inside, an impressive hall stretched out before them, adorned with desks where relics of the precursors lay scattered beneath a thick shroud of dust. Somewhere amidst this jumble of artifacts, an **Access Pass** lay hidden, waiting to be unearthed.

As the room was combed for clues, the temperature began to gradually climb, and after a few minutes, a deafening crash resounded from beyond the northern blast doors. In a matter of moments, a **Balor** charged through the containment cell, smashing the doors to pieces and unleashing mayhem upon the adventurers.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Balor** *(SRD, p.270)*

##### Tactics:
The **Balor** is in a state of rage, having been imprisoned here for centuries. A malfunctioning collar gives him a -2 penalty to all his saving throws.

##### Treasure:
In his holding cell, the demon had melted electrum coins into a grim image of a demon lord worth 2000 gold pieces.
}}

#### Overseer Office
As the adventuring party makes their way into the abandoned underground base, they come across an overseer office. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting eerie shadows across the walls. A large, ornate desk dominates the center of the room, with a high-backed chair situated behind it. Shelves line the walls, filled with leather-bound tomes and strange, magical artifacts. A map of unknown lands hangs on the wall, marked with arcane symbols and mysterious runes. Dusty papers and parchment litter the floor, hinting at the chaos that once ensued in this forgotten place.

There is also trap - a *Glyph of Warding*  cast above ceiling. Characters, who cannot perceive it  through the wall (for example with a *Detect Magic* spell), need to make a successful **DC 14 Perception (Wisdom)** check to notice it. The glyph explodes whenever someone enters the room, dealing 5d8 lightning damage on a failed **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. Searching the room proves to be fruitful - there are **Boots of Levitation** under one of the shelves.

#### Boiler Room
The boiler room is a cramped, sweltering space filled with the dull roar of machinery. Pipes and conduits snake across the walls and ceiling, glowing with a dim red light. Steam hisses from valves and vents, obscuring the air with a thick cloud of mist. The floor is slick with condensation, and the heat is almost unbearable.

In the center of the room stands an enormous, ancient boiler, its metal shell covered in rust and grime. The boiler is warm to the touch, and the sound of its laboring machinery fills the air. The room is suffused with a reddish glow from the furnaces, and the walls are streaked with soot.

The heat is being maintained by five elemental creatures, bound to this place ages ago. They are unusually calm, absorbed with their eternal duty, and can participate in a civil conversation. They do not know much about this complex; only that the same wizard who summoned them had locked up a Balor in one of the holding cells. The elementals wish to be free of their duty, and will ask to be relieved; the party can offer to cast *Dispel Magic*, *Banishment*, or other spell that will transport them to their native planes; in return, the **Fiery Guardian** will point to the party that in storage area, or more precisely in the ventilation tunnel there is a *Ring of Fire Resistance*.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Fiery Guardian** *(SotP, p.146)*
* 2x **Dust Mephit** *(SRD, p.330)*
* 2x **Magma Mephit** *(SRD, p.331)*

##### Tactics:
The elementals are bound to maintain the heat in this abandoned place, and will respond with aggression to attempts at turning off the furnaces.

##### Treasure:
A **+2 Warhammer** and 421 electrum pieces.
}}

#### Bathrooms
The bathrooms are a dimly lit, cramped space, with rows of rusted metal stalls lining the walls. The air is thick with the musty scent of old water and mildew. A few flickering fluorescent lights provide the only illumination, casting eerie shadows on the stained tile floors. The sound of dripping water echoes through the space, and the occasional skittering of small creatures can be heard in the shadows.

One of the stalls has a broken door that hangs off its hinges, and the rusted toilet inside is overflowing with stagnant water. A broken metal mirror hangs above a row of grimy sinks, its surface marred by deep scratches and cracks. A pile of discarded clothes lies in the corner, covered in a layer of dust.

The other bathroom has some still functioning guardians, who attack any intruders on sight.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 3x **Elite Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.166)*

##### Tactics:
All three machines begin the fight by throwing a Pulse Grenade, after which they take cover inside the stalls.

##### Treasure:
There is a pair of **Bracers of Defense** below the  mirror.
}}

As the adventurers cautiously explore the space, they may discover a few hidden compartments, containing old medical supplies or small caches of survival gear, provided that they pass a **DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)** check. The stash contains two medical kits, and six *Potions of Greater Healing*.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Storage
The storage room is cramped, dusty and filled with stacks of old crates and containers. The air is stale and musty, and the dim light flickers uncertainty from a single overhead panel. The walls are lined with rows of rusted metal shelves, many of them collapsed, their contents scattered across the floor.

The crates and containers hold a variety of supplies and equipment, but most of them have long since been picked over. A few of the crates still hold usable items, such as a cache of spare parts or a few functioning tools, but most of the containers have been smashed open and their contents scattered across the floor.

Behind the crates, after removing the ventilation grille off the wall, a *Ring of Fire Resistance* hidden here untold centuries ago can be found. It is not visible from the outside, and the steel wall prevents it from being detected with *Detect Magic* spell, but finding it requires no check, once the characters have been informed of its presence by the fiery guardian from the boiler room.

\column
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Conference Room
The conference room is a spacious, dimly lit chamber, filled with rows of dusty chairs and a long table that dominates the center of the room. The walls are covered in faded murals and maps, and the air is thick with the scent of old paper and leather.

At the head of the table sits an ornate chair, lined with unknown, smooth material. The chair is flanked by two rows of chairs to each side, each equally lavish and imposing. The walls are rough and uneven, as if they were carved from solid rock.

The room is silent and still, as if frozen in time. The only sounds are the distant hum of machinery and the faint rustle of paper in the breeze. The atmosphere is solemn and foreboding, as if something important happened here a long time ago.

On top of the table, there are several glass plates, shimmering with cyan light - the **Access Pass**, that will allow the party to return to **ICCAI** and proceed with their main quest.

## Chapter 16
# Mind of a God
}}

Using the Access Pass, the party can finally enter the overseer's office. Following the guidelines of **ICCAI**, they restore as much of its functions as possible, which does greatly increase the capabilities of the AI. 

In fact, it has pondered how to bypass the restrictions on its memory, and - when trying to establish connection with any remnants of the precursors it indeed had found one complex, deep in the northern Dihtilla jungle. Although the virtual guardian of that place was damaged beyond repair, **ICCAI** has managed to copy its restricted memory into its 'vessel', so to speak, and if he were to receive a physical copy, he would be able to decipher it, and provide the party with the answers they are searching for.

### Welcome to the Jungle
As the party enters the Dihtilla Jungle, they will find themselves in a hostile environment, where disease and predators await them.

As the party ventures into the jungle, for each hour of their travel, roll a d6. On a 1, an encounter happens! To determine, what is it exactly that the party encounters, roll another d6, and run a corresponding encounter from the table below.

| d6 | Encounter              |
|:--:|:----------------------|
| 1  | **Enslaved Lizards**   |
| 2  | **Ominous Honking**    |
| 3  | **Blinking Spiders**   | 
| 4  | **Angry Tree Spirits** |
| 5  | **Stone Ruins**        |
| 6  | **Oozing Menace**      |

\column

#### Enslaved Lizards
The party is being attacked by a group of angry dinosaurs. The creatures approach the party dashing through the thick jungle with ferocious roars.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Tyrannosaurus	Rex** *(SRD, p.279)*

##### Tactics:
A successful **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check is enough to hear the creatures early enough to prepare. Grant characters who pass this check a surprise round. These giant lizards fight to the death. 
}}

A character proficient in **Nature** might realize that this attack was unusual - as if someone directed these creatures towards the party, since this type of beast doesn't live, let alone hunt in packs.

#### Ominous Honking
During their travel in the jungle, the party is ambushed by **Honku** - terrifying people inhabiting these dangerous areas of the great jungle. Following an intimidating display of horrifying honking, the cultists begin their attack to drive back the outsiders away.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Honku Cultist** *(SotP, p.152)*

##### Tactics:
Honku attack from hiding, and retreat once their HP falls below 25.

##### Environmental Hazards:
Due to their great knowledge of the environment, at the end of their turn, the Honku can try to hide as a bonus action, and they do so with advantage.

##### Treasure:
Two adamantine amulets made of scraps, each worth 500 gold pieces, and a *Scroll of Hold Monster*.
}}

If any Honku escapes, it can be tracked with a successful **DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)** check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the party completely loses track of the trail, and cannot repeat the attempts. The Honku retreat to the Gate of Heart of Metal, where twin dragons have their lair.

}}

#### Blinking Spiders
While the party traverses the jungle, they are being stalked by a pack of **Phase Spiders**. At an opportune moment, they attack.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 10x **Phase Spider** *(SRD, p.385)*

##### Tactics:
The phase spiders constantly blink in and out of the material plane. Each of the spiders retreat if they begin their turn in the Ethereal Plane with 10 or less Hit Points.
}}

#### Angry Tree Spirits
The jungle is inhabited not only by creatures of pure malice, but also insane guardians. The treants of Dihtilla have been driven mad, and are *chaotic evil* instead of *chaotic good*. They can be healed from their insanity with *Greater Restoration* or a similar spell.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 2x **Treant** *(SRD, p.351)*

##### Tactics:
Treants stand motionless until a character approaches within its range, then they strike, trying to surprise the intruders.

##### Environmental Hazards:
As the jungle is filled with ancient trees, a treant can use it's *Animate Trees* feature as a bonus action.

##### Treasure:
An adamantine shard stuck in the treant's bark, worth 300 gp.
}}

If these guardians of the forest are restored to sanity, they can offer guidance to the party. Although the most important advice they can give is to leave, they can show the party direction to the "Heart of Metal", if asked about metal structures in the jungle. If the party decides to go further in that direction, Treants offer one more bit of information: a pair of **Green Dragons** have made their lair in that area. They are guarding their territory together, probably because the female has recently laid eggs.

#### Stone Ruins
During their travels, the party discovers ruined altair amidst crushed walls, overwatched by a statue of a naga (a dormant **Stone Golem**). If they attempt to steal from the altair, the guardian awakens, and is quickly supported by two **Guardian Nagas** who lurk nearby. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 1x **Stone Golem** *(SRD, p.317)*
* 2x **Guardian Nagas** *(SRD, p.335)*

##### Tactics:
The guardians of this place cannot be appeased, but they will drop the chase after several minutes, if the Emerald Chalice from the altair is returned.

##### Treasure:
Within the central chamber of the temple lies an ancient altar with an engraved Emerald Chalice, worth 1000 gp, and a golden helmet - the *Everfaithful*.
}}

#### Oozing Menace
Dangerous predators lie in ambush not only on the ground, but also up high, in the tree branches. As the party ventures into the jungle, they are ambushed by a malicious **Black Pudding** and **Shambling Mounds**

* 4x **Shambling Mounds** *(SRD, p.345)*

##### Tactics:
The **Black Pudding** starts the encounter by oozing from a tree branch, targeting a character wearing metal armor or wielding metal weapons. The **Shambling Mounds** move deliberately through the undergrowth, ambushing the characters and attempting to grapple them.

##### Treasure:
The **Black Pudding** has absorbed several metal objects, including a magical *Ring of Acid Resistance*.
}}

### Heart of Metal - Gate
The gate to the precursor complex is a nesting lair to a pair of green dragons. The entrance will open before any humanoids, and so it is not necessary to fight the **green dragons**: stealth and diplomacy might be a viable solution. If the party tries their luck with stealth, but don't wait for the creatures to leave - the dragons are alarmed by opening doors.

If the party announces themselves, they might attempt to negotiate passage with the dragon. A successful **DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion)**  check is enough to be granted passage. Characters which have procured a valuable gift have advantage on this check. However, if they do so, and pass a **DC 15 Wisdom (Insight)**  check will realize that the dragons wish to let the party plunder the complex, and then kill them for their loot.

#### Dragon Lair
The dragon lair is an open space, on and around a horizontal metallic door on the ground. The area is 100 feet wide in diameter, and is surrounded by thick jungle growths.



{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Adult Green Dragon** *(SRD, p.285)*
* 1x **Young Green Dragon** *(SRD, p.285)*

##### Tactics:
The male (**Adult Green Dragon**) is more experienced, and prefers to keep his distance, making use of its poison breath. The female (**Young Green Dragon**) prefers combat on the ground, but may also try to grapple weaker opponents, fly up, and drop them to their deaths, before diving again.

##### Environmental Hazards:
Thick forest around the glade is considered to be a difficult terrain - and in case a dragon would like to drop a party member onto the ground, 

##### Treasure:
There are two dragon hoards scattered around the metal construction. 

###### Young Green Dragon Hoard:
2 bronze crowns worth 250 gp, 5 gold rings with bloodstones worth 50 gp each, silk robe with gold embroidery worth 250 gp, silver necklace with a gemstone pendant worth 250 gp, *Bag of holding*, *Pearl of Power* and coins: 554 cp, 11625 sp, 2462 gp, 141 pp.

###### Adult Green Dragon Hoard:
Bottle stopper cork embossed with gold leaf and set with amethysts worth 750 gp, ceremonial electrum dagger with a black pearl in the pommel worth 750 gp, ceremonial golden dagger with a pearl in the pommel worth 750 gp, painted gold war mask worth 950 gp, silver and gold brooch worth 750 gp, *Storm Forged Plate*, *Bracers of Archery*, *Elven Chain*, *Scroll of Purify Food and Drink)*, *Scroll of Word of Radiance*.

### Inside the Heart of Metal
The Heart of Metal is an underground facility built by the Precursors to develop their technologies further beyond. It is in a state of complete disrepair, a malfunction of its AI core, which became hostile and turned the machines against its creators. Fortunately for the heroes - the AI had been disabled by **ICCAI**. Unfortunately - the machines were not.

#### Cooling Chamber
The first room of this facility is a 20 feet wide, 50 feet long corridor, shrouded with ice, and guarded by rogue machines. It's completely dark.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies:
* 2x **FR 3323** *(SotP, p.164)*

##### Tactics:
The mechs are blocking off the way to the next chamber, to keep the party in the cold environment for as long as possible. If a character manages to escape, one of them might follow, and try to grab and bring him back into the chamber, under the effect of residual cold.

##### Environmental Hazard:
The entire area is extremely cold. All living creatures take 1d6 cold damage when they end their turn there. The ground is slippery due to a thin layer of ice, and every creature that moves on it has to make a **DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics)** check, or fall prone. A creature may declare to move slowly (as if the ice was a difficult terrain) to gain advantage on this check.

##### Treasure:
On top of a metal crate, in grasp of a frozen corpse's hand, there is a *Guardian Angel* amulet.
}}

#### Forgotten Workshop
This underground area is a well-preserved relic of the advanced technologies developed by the Precursors. It spans a vast expanse filled with machinery, tools, and prototypes of ingenious devices, providing valuable insights into the technological prowess of this ancient civilization.

{{note
The air is heavy with an otherworldly hum, punctuated by faint, intermittent mechanical clicks. The workshop's walls are adorned with intricate diagrams and schematics, illuminated by the soft, pulsating glow of embedded gemstones.

{{descriptive

##### Enemies:
* 2x **Malfunctioning FR3323** *(SotP, p.164)*

##### Tactics:
These mechs are malfunctioning. Replace their **Freezing Gun** with **Electric Sparks**:

*FR 3323 launches a fan of electric sparks in a 60 ft. cone. All creatures in the area take 36 (8d8) lightning damage, halved on a successful **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw. (Recharge 4-6).*

##### Environmental Hazard:
The workshop's machinery occasionally sparks and emits discharges of residual energy. Characters that start their turn in proximity to malfunctioning devices have to make a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw, or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

##### Treasure:
The workshop contains scattered caches of Precursor artifacts: a pair of *Advanced Goggles* and a *Steel Arm*.
}}

By exploring the Forgotten Precursor Workshop, the party can unravel the mysteries of the past and potentially harness the remnants of advanced technology for their own purposes. However, navigating the workshop requires vigilance and resourcefulness, as its hidden wonders are guarded by the very mechanisms designed to protect the Precursors' innovations.

#### Arcane Repository
An adjacent chamber is filled with a collection of magical knowledge and artifacts amassed by the Precursors.

A soft, ambient glow suffuses the air as shelves upon shelves of tomes, scrolls, and enchanted items line the repository's walls. Wisps of silvery mist drift among the shelves, and an occasional whisper of incantations can be heard in the distance.

Exploring the Arcane Repository offers a glimpse into the Precursors' mastery of magic, and it presents the opportunity for characters to enhance their own arcane abilities - an empty display, as the Precursors are no more.

### Dimensional Anomaly
Also adjacent to the Forgotten Workshop lies a chamber of bewildering strangeness. This space exists as a rift between dimensions, and within it, the laws of reality warp and twist, creating an environment where the fabric of existence is malleable and unpredictable.

{{note
The air is charged with a surreal energy, causing colors to shift and meld, and faint echoes of distant voices and laughter reverberate. The boundaries of the chamber seem to blur, as if it connects to other realities.
}}

{{note
##### Environmental Hazards:
Reality itself is unstable in this chamber. Characters might face gravity shifts, temporal distortions, or even sudden transitions to alternate planes.
}}

Inside this very room, there is also the AI Core that the party had been searching for in this facility. Now, the only question is: how will the party leave? 

### Resolution
With the last element required to finish the repairs, and divine the location which **Alexander Grisseaux** had been searching (and found) - The Forge of Guardians. Unfortunately, upon returning to ***ICCAI*** It turns out that to replace the AI Core, one last thing will be required - a sample of blood taken from a Precursor.

## Chapter 17
# Blood of the Precursors
}}

In order for the innermost chamber of the Tomb of the Precursors to be accessed, a sample of blood from one of the creators will be required by the party. This fact was not previously known to **ICCAI**, and upon discovering that the doors are not opening, he will request a description of the problem. **ICCAI** will then ask the party to return at a later time, such as a day, a week, or even a month, while compiling relevant data. 

This time can be used for completing various lingering tasks, undertaking a side adventure, or performing downtime activities, depending on how urgently the party should act. When they return to this place at a later point, **ICCAI** will inform them with regret that the blood sample which would be required to enter the vault where new core could be installed,had been stored in the Order of Saint Blood, which the party knows was destroyed by Thalnos, and thus cannot be used for that purpose anymore. **ICCAI** may also be unaware of the location of the other sample, which is located in Louthesdon's deep temple. Consequently, **ICCAI** will ask the players to conduct an investigation and locate the sample.

It is important for as much of the personal quests that the characters have begun to be resolved, before the  party discovers the location of the blood sample; as a Game Master, you should steer the party towards these goals, tying them to a possible way of attaining the necessary knowledge - characters may hear of the blood's supposed location from bards, Shamani from a tribe they encounter, or a Seer they may have met. Regardless of the source, the investigation will ultimately lead them to the Temple-Ziggurat of Louthesdon, and this book will resume the adventure from that point.

### Sacred Temple-Ziggurat
The very heart of Louthesdon is an ancient stone ziggurat, which had been built by an ancient civilization to the Precursors, whom the Aequeti living in Louthesdon believe to be the Old Gods.

The Ziggurat serves as a temple, and a cemetery; it's upper levels hosting sacrificial altars to the Old Gods, and living quarters for the Seers; while below the ground level, in the closely guarded catacombs, there are catacombs where the Aequeti bury their dead - and secrets. There is only one entrance, and it's guarded by incorruptible guards, blessed by sacred rituals to be immune to mind-controlling effects, so that they wouldn't falter in their duty.

\column

The tunnels below the ziggurat of the Old Gods will be described further in the chapter, as the challenge of this part of the adventure is how to actually enter it, as the forbidden Ziggurat grounds are protected by powerful wards which prevent the use of teleportation magic.

There are many ways to accomplish that; at this point of the adventure the party should possess many items of great magical power, on top of being true veterans, and so they may conceivably fight their way in; which could prove to be a challenge, but not an impossible task. If the party attempts it, gather the strike teams of the factions present in the temple-city (described in further part of this chapter) to oppose the party.

Sneaking into the tomb would be a near impossible task; unless a person was snuck in as a corpse, or in a state that would be hard to discern from death. Only the Aequeti are allowed burial in the crypts below the ziggurat (see: Appendix C - Player Character Options - Aequeti Tribesman background), but a feign death spell, or similar magic, could fool the tribesmen, and perhaps a burial of this person could be arranged - after which, the sample of the precursor blood could be located and obtained.

Another way of gaining entry would be by permission form the Seers, though they are unwilling to allow the party inside, even if they are part of the Aequeti tribe. Resolving the further described conflict of the casts in Louthesdon is one way of gaining their favor, but there is also another - a person, who would complete the six trials, and touched all 6 of the Tablets of Power (described in Appendix A - Magic Items) would be respected as a person blessed by the ancestors and the Old Gods, and would be let in without trouble.

But maybe the party will be unwilling to help the Seers, and would instead like to stand in support of the Shamani, in the ensuing conflict in Louthesdon. In that case, gratitude for successfully relieving the current Seers of power could be enough to be allowed into the sacred corridors below the temple-ziggurat.

### Conflict of the Castes
The conflict between the Seers and the Shamani in Louthesdon is deeply rooted in the history of the Aequeti people. The two groups represent different interpretations of the role of magic in their society and their relationship with the Old Gods.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

The Seers believe that magic should be controlled and regulated, and that the Old Gods can only be appeased through strict adherence to rituals and ceremonies. They see themselves as the guardians of tradition and the keepers of ancient knowledge, and they view the Shamani as reckless and dangerous. The Shamani, on the other hand, believe that magic should be free and natural, and that the Old Gods speak to them directly through their connection to the natural world. They see themselves as the true heirs of the Aequeti culture, and they view the Seers as corrupt and oppressive.

The conflict between the Seers and the Shamani has simmered for centuries, but it came to a head when a group of Shamani discovered a powerful source of magic in the forests outside of Louthesdon. The Seers, fearing the uncontrolled use of this magic, sent a group of their own to seize control of the source.

The resulting conflict was bloody and brutal, and it left deep scars on both sides. The Shamani, feeling betrayed by the Seers, began to openly challenge their authority, and soon the entire city was divided into two factions.

As the party enters Louthesdon, they may be forced to choose a side in the conflict. They may align themselves with the Seers, seeking to restore order and stability to the city, or they may side with the Shamani, seeking to overthrow the corrupt regime and restore the true Aequeti culture.

The forces of the Seers consist primarily of the Aequeti tribesmen who have pledged their loyalty to the faction. These warriors are highly trained in the use of magic and are equipped with powerful enchanted weapons and armor. They are fiercely loyal to the Seers and will stop at nothing to protect the ziggurat temple and the knowledge it contains.

The Seers also have access to powerful magic, which they use to protect the ziggurat temple and enforce their laws. They are skilled in divination and can detect any unauthorized use of magic within the city. They also have powerful wards and enchantments in place to prevent teleportation magic from being used to bypass their defenses.

### The Seers
The Seers are a powerful faction in Louthesdon, and they are the guardians of the ziggurat temple and the ancient knowledge it contains. They are the keepers of the rituals and ceremonies that appease the Old Gods, and they believe that magic should be controlled and regulated.

The Seers are led by a High Seer, who is chosen from among their ranks based on their mastery of the ancient arts and their adherence to tradition. The current High Seer is an elderly woman named Zareen, who has held the position for over three decades. She is a stern and uncompromising leader, who values stability and order above all else.

The Seers are a secretive group, and they do not trust outsiders easily. They maintain strict control over access to the ziggurat temple, and they are quick to punish those who violate their laws. The penalties for unauthorized use of magic or desecration of sacred sites can range from fines and imprisonment to exile or even death.

The Seers are not without their detractors, however. Many of the younger generation, particularly those who have had contact with the Shamani or other outsiders, chafe under the strict rules and regulations imposed by the Seers. They feel that the Seers are too conservative and resistant to change, and that their obsession with tradition is holding back the Aequeti people.

Despite these criticisms, the Seers remain a powerful force in Louthesdon, and their control over the ziggurat temple gives them a significant degree of leverage over the city's other factions. They are fiercely protective of their power and influence, and they will stop at nothing to maintain their position as the guardians of the Old Gods.

#### Forces of the Seers
The Seers of Louthesdon are a formidable force, led by the enigmatic and powerful High Seer Zareen. At her side were six master-level Seers, each possessing their own unique set of magical abilities and knowledge. These Seers were revered by the rest of the order and served as advisors to Zareen in all matters of governance and spiritual guidance.

Below the master-level Seers are the acolytes, who number at seventeen. These are initiates to the order, learning the ways of divination and prophecy under the tutelage of their more experienced peers. Though they lack the mastery of the masters, they are still formidable opponents in their own right, capable of unleashing devastating spells and curses.

Protecting the Seers are the elite seer guards, numbering at twenty-four. These guards were hand-selected by Zareen herself and trained to the peak of physical and mental conditioning. They are armed with enchanted weapons and armor, and are fiercely loyal to their High Seer and her cause.

Beneath the elite seer guards were the regular seer guards, numbering at exactly two hundred and forty - ten guardians for each elite. These guards are still highly trained, but lack the specialized equipment and experience of their elite counterparts. They are nonetheless a formidable force, capable of swarming an opponent and using their numbers to overwhelm them.

Finally, there are the Stone Guardians, seven towering golems of enchanted stone that served as the ultimate protectors of the Seers' temple. These golems are impervious to most forms of magic and are nearly indestructible. They are fearsome opponents, capable of crushing a fully armored knight with a single blow.

### High Seer Zareen
Zareen is the current High Seer and leader of the Seers in Louthesdon. She is a powerful mage, renowned for her divinatory powers and her ability to see into the future. Her long silver hair is often braided and adorned with gemstones, and her piercing green eyes seem to hold the secrets of the universe.

Zareen was born into the Seer caste and showed an early aptitude for magic. She was trained by Elandor himself and quickly rose through the ranks of the Seers to become one of their most powerful members. When Elandor retired from his position as High Seer, Zareen was chosen to take his place.

As High Seer, Zareen is responsible for overseeing the Seers and their activities. She is a fierce defender of the Seer caste and will stop at nothing to protect their interests. She is also deeply committed to the study and preservation of ancient knowledge and artifacts. She believes that the key to unlocking the mysteries of the past lies in understanding the magic of the Precursors.

Zareen is a controversial figure in Louthesdon. Many see her as an elitist who is out of touch with the common people. She is often criticized for her close relationship with the ruling class and her perceived lack of concern for the plight of the lower castes. However, her supporters see her as a visionary who is working tirelessly to unlock the secrets of the past and bring prosperity to Louthesdon.

### The Shamani
The Shamani are a faction in Louthesdon that comprises the city's tribal shamans and medicine men. They are deeply connected to nature and the spirits of the land, and they use their knowledge of the natural world to heal the sick and protect the people of Louthesdon.

The Shamani are opposed to the Seers, whom they see as being too focused on arcane knowledge and power. They believe that the ziggurat temple is a symbol of the Seers' hubris and arrogance, and they feel that the knowledge contained within its walls should be shared with the people of Louthesdon rather than being hoarded by the Seers.

#### Forces of the Shamani
Although the Shamani do not have access to magic so specialized as the Seers, their strength lies in numbers. Forty-three Aequeti Shamani, one for each tribe, have been secretly discussing their disillusionment with the decisions of the seers. Each of them a revered warchief of their people is a force to be reckoned with. One of these Shamani is Elder Kaveh himself, who is most revered for his tactical wit, and monstrous physical might.

There is also a considerable number of Aequeti tribesmen, whom, in the event of an open conflict, are prepared to stand up and fight side by side with the Shamani of their tribe - together, over a thousand men, ready to give up their lives; twenty-five hundred of them being true paragons of their tribes, Aequeti Heroes.

### Elder Kaveh
The Shamani do not have a single leader, but instead operate as a collective group of tribal shamans and medicine men, however there is a certain wise and respected elder Aaracokra named Kaveh. 

He is a tall and imposing figure, with weathered feathers and a long white beak.. Despite his advanced age, Kaveh exudes strength and vitality, and his piercing brown eyes betray a sharp intellect and unwavering will.

Kaveh has been seen by many as the greater of the Shamani for over thirty years, and in that time he has earned the respect and loyalty of his people through his tireless dedication to their well-being. He is known for his deep connection to the spirits of nature and his ability to communicate with them, as well as his shrewd diplomatic skills and tactical acumen.

{{pageNumber,auto,color:#FFF }}
{{footnote,color:#FFF   PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

Under Kaveh's guidance, the Shamani have thrived in Antarriah, forging close bonds between the tribes and earning a reputation as wise and honorable leaders. Kaveh is a staunch defender of the traditional ways of the Shamani, but he is also open-minded and pragmatic, always willing to adapt to changing circumstances and explore new avenues for cooperation and growth.

Despite his many accomplishments, Kaveh remains humble and approachable, always willing to listen to the concerns of his people and offer wise counsel. He is greatly loved and respected by the Shamani, and his leadership has been instrumental in shaping their culture and guiding them through times of both peace and strife.

### Siding with the Seers
Siding with the Seers can be a challenging task for any adventuring party. While the Seers are a powerful force in Louthesdon, they are also notoriously reclusive and often viewed as aloof and arrogant by outsiders. However, if the party can prove their worth and earn the trust of the Seers, they may find themselves with powerful allies and access to invaluable knowledge and resources.

If the party decides to side with the Seers, the only way to initiate contact with them is to provide them with valuable information that could aid them in their struggle against the Shamani. The Seers are known to be a reclusive and elitist group, and they do not take kindly to outsiders meddling in their affairs, however, if the party has information about a coup being prepared by the Shamani against the Seers, this could be their opportunity to gain the favor of the Seers. The Seers value their own power and authority above all else, and any threat to their control over the region is taken very seriously.

Once the Seers have been alerted to the Shamani's plans, the party could assist in fortifying the Seers' temple, setting up traps and wards to keep the Shamani's forces at bay. The party could also assist in training the Seers' guards and acolytes, helping them to improve their combat skills and magical abilities.

If the Shamani's coup is successful and they manage to overthrow the Seers, the party could work to rally support for the Seers and launch a counter-attack. They could also try to negotiate with the Shamani, attempting to reason with them and prevent further bloodshed.

Throughout all of this, the party would need to be careful not to offend or anger the Seers, who are known for their seclusiveness and arrogance. They would need to tread carefully and act with diplomacy and tact, always keeping the Seers' interests in mind.

\column

### Siding with the Shamani
Siding with the Shamani is not an easy choice for many adventurers, as it means going against the powerful and mysterious Seers of Louthesdon. However, for some, the prospect of overthrowing the Seers and ushering in a new era of freedom is too tempting to resist.

If the party decides to side with the Shamani, they will find themselves in the midst of a complex and dangerous conflict. The Shamani are not as organized or powerful as the Seers, and they lack the magical abilities that make the Seers so formidable.  Once the party has gained the trust of the Shamani, they will be privy to their plans for the coup. The Shamani plan to launch a surprise attack on the Seers' temple, using their superior numbers and tactical knowledge to overwhelm the Seers and their forces. The party will be tasked with assisting in this attack in any way they can.

#### Disarming the Seer Guard
Disarming the Seer Guard can be a difficult task as they are highly trained and loyal to the Seers. However, with careful planning and execution, it is possible for the party to succeed, as the weapons of the Seer Guard are kept in a single armory.

The first step is to gather intelligence on the layout of the Seer Guard's barracks and armory. This can be done through reconnaissance, infiltration, or even bribery of informants. Once the party has a good  idea of the layout, they can plan their approach.

One option is to negotiate  with the Seer Guard and convince them to hand over their weapons peacefully. This would require a **DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion)** check, as well as some leverage to convince the guards that it is in their best interest to disarm themselves. This could be done by revealing evidence of the Seers' corruption and appealing to the guards' sense of duty and honor.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Seer Acolyte** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 1x **Elite Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.158)*
* 12x **Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.157)*

##### Tactics:
The Guardians gladly give their lives for the Seer acolyte under their protection. After more than a half of them dies, the Seer acolyte attempts to escape, and alarm the rest of the Seer caste.

##### Treasure:
In the armory, there are hundreds of spears, quarterstaffs, leather, and hide armors. Among them, there is also a weapon hanger with six *+2 Spears*, and six *+2 Hide armors*. On top of one of the bed tables, there is a *Amulet of River's Flow*.
}}

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

Another option is stealth and subterfuge to infiltrate the barracks and disarm the guards of the armory without them ever knowing. However, the barracks are most of the time full of soldiers on duty, and would prove challenging to enter unnoticed.
Finally, the party could try to use force and brute strength to overpower the guards and take their weapons. This would be a risky approach and could potentially lead to a full-scale battle with the Seer Guard. However, if the party is confident in their combat abilities enough to close the brawl fast and efficiently enough, this may be a viable option.

Accomplishing this task one way or the other leads to the forces of the Seers being greatly reduced, either because of how many guards with refuse to fight because they have been convinced to, or because they will not have the equipment necessary

#### Dismantling the Wards
A complex and delicate task that requires a skilled team with knowledge of magic and enchantments. The Seers are known to have powerful wards protecting their temple, which could hinder any attempt to overthrow them.

However, if a party were to side with the Shamani and attempt to dismantle these wards, they would need to first gather information about the wards themselves. This would involve infiltrating the Seers' temple or seeking out individuals with knowledge of the enchantments. Once the wards are understood, the party would need to come up with a plan to counteract or neutralize them.

A team of skilled mages would be necessary for this task, and they would need to work together closely to ensure the wards are dismantled without triggering any countermeasures from the Seers. The Shamani may have their own mages or scholars who could aid in this endeavor, but it would be important to keep these allies hidden from the Seers' prying eyes. If the party is noticed entering the chambers near the Temple-Ziggurat, some of the Seers will confront them.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Seer** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 2x **Seer Acolyte** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 3x **Elite Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.158)*

##### Tactics:
The Guardians gladly give their lives for the Seers. If more than one Seer dies, the other two attempt to escape, to alarm the High Seer.

##### Treasure:
The Seer is wearing *Robe of the Archmagi*, while one of the acolytes wears a *Brooch of Shielding*.
}}

Once the wards are dismantled, the Shamani could launch a surprise attack on the Seers, catching them off guard and potentially overthrowing their leadership, by using teleportation magic. Moreover, if the wards are disabled, there is nothing preventing the party from simply using such magic to enter the premises of the crypts beneath the Ziggurat-Temple.

#### Dispelling the Stone Guardians
The Shamani, being skilled in the arts of arcane magic and shamanism, had developed a method of dispelling the enchanted stone that gave the guardians their invulnerability. This method required a specific combination of rare ingredients and intricate ritualistic chants, but if performed correctly, it would strip the golems of their magical defenses, leaving them vulnerable to physical damage.

The party, working alongside the Shamani, would need to gather these ingredients and carefully follow the instructions for the ritual. The party would need to travel to the temple of the Seers, where the two dozens of the Seer Guard stood watch. The Shamani would lead the ritual, chanting the complex incantations as the party protected them from any attacks by the guardians. This undertaking sparks the open conflict, if it had not already been started. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 24x **Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.157)*  
OR
* 2x **Seer Guard Troop** *(SotP, p.157)*

##### Tactics:
The Guardians try to disrupt the ritual, by attacking the shamani, who accompany the party. Each round of combat, the shamani can use their action to enter a meditative channeling stance, which requires concentration (as if they were concentrating on a spell), and lasts for one minute. After at least one of the shamani completes his channeling at this location, the ritual is complete.
}}

If successful, the ritual renders the Stone Guardians of the Seers vulnerable to all damage, on top of having disadvantage on all attack rolls.

### Uprising
The open confrontation with the Seers leads to an all-out uprising. As the fighting erupts in the city streets, there are three areas where the battle is undecided, but in which a success is critical to take over (or hold) the Temple-Ziggurat. It is enough to support a chosen side in two of them.

The areas of most important, and most intense fighting are: the temple courtyard, marketplace and the Shamani yurt.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote  PART 2 | SHARDS OF THE PAST}}
\page

#### Temple Courtyard
The entrance to the Temple-Ziggurat is surrounded with a large courtyard, guarded not only by the seer guard, combated by the wandering folk, but also a small number of more powerful opponents: A seer with a small escort, which has to be handled by someone more powerful than the wandering Aequeti folk. 

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Seer** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 2x **Seer Acolyte** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 2x **Elite Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.158)*
* 1x **Stone Guardian** (Optional) *(SotP, p.147)*

##### Tactics:
The battle rages on around the combatants. At initiative count 20, every character in initiative order rolls a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw. On failure, he receives 3d6 piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage - a result of the chaos around them. On a success, the damage is halved.

##### Treasure:
The Seer has a pair of *Gloves of Healing Grasp*.
}}

#### The Marketplace
The marketplace is where the most bloody fights are taking place, as the forces of the Seers have ventured towards the Shamani Yurts. The side which prevails here, can advance through the city, and move their forces more freely - therefore providing support to a preferred side is key to maintaining the advantage in the uprising.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Seer Guard Troop** *(SotP, p.158)*
* 7x **Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.157)*
* 1x **Stone Guardian** (Optional) *(SotP, p.147)*

##### Tactics:
The battle rages on around the combatants. At initiative count 20, every character in initiative order rolls a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw. On failure, he receives 3d6 piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage - a result of the chaos around them. On a success, the damage is halved.
}}

#### The Shamani Yurt
The gathering place of the Shamani Command is also under attack. A small force of Seer Guard has tied up the personal guards of the commanders, and four elite guards - accompanied by a Stone Guardian, if they are still operational - moves to cut the serpent's head, as the **High Seer** put it.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Elite Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.158)*
* 1x **Stone Guardian** (Optional) *(SotP, p.147)*

##### Tactics:
The battle rages on around the combatants. At initiative count 20, every character in initiative order rolls a **DC 15 Dexterity** saving throw. On failure, he receives 3d6 piercing, bludgeoning or slashing damage - a result of the chaos around them. On a success, the damage is halved.
}}

#### The Temple-Ziggurat
The final confrontation is with the **High Seer Zareen** herself.  She is willing to negotiate with the party. If the party has told anyone (with the exception of any of the Shamani, especially **Elder Kaveh**), she might know about the party's desire to obtain the Blood of the Precursors, and she will offer it to them, if they halt, and put **Elder Kaveh** in restraints. She does keep that promise, if the party complies.

She can be persuaded to step down, to avoid bloodshed with a successful **DC 25 Charisma (Persuasion)** or **DC 26 Charisma (Intimidation)** check. In that case, she and half of the remaining Seers go into exile, from which, at your discretion, she might plan revenge.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **High Seer Zareen** *(SotP, p.155)*
* 1x **Seer** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 2x **Seer Acolyte** *(SotP, p.156)*
* 3x **Elite Seer Guard** *(SotP, p.158)*

##### Tactics:
The party is accompanied by **Elder Kaveh** *(SotP, p.154)*, who helps them in battle.

Elite Seer Guard fight to the death, unless ordered otherwise by a Seer. High Seer Zareen surrenders if her HP drops below 10 Hit Points, or if 3 of her allies are dead or unconscious.
}}

### Resolution
In gratitude, **Elder Kaveh** or **High Seer Zareen** grants the party a sample containing a sample of blood. Now, they will be able to take the Blood of the Precursors and use it to access the last chamber in **ICCAI**'s tomb. This means, that the AI can recover data from dormant memory, finding the location of the Forge of Guardians, and **Alexander Grisseaux**.

{{chapter,four,wide
## Chapter 18
# The Forge of Guardians
}}

Now it is time for **Alexander Grisseaux** to appear and confront the party. He had become aware of their intrusions into the complexes of the Precursors, and is displeased that someone may try to block off his last way of departing to his own world, and will not back off. He sets a large number of machines right when the party tries to enter the **Tomb of the Precursors**. If the party tries to use teleportation magic, a mishap happens as a consequence of his trap, and they are teleported before the entrance to the Caves of the Black Smile Tribe.

There, **Alexander** might threaten the party, explain his goals and demand that they forfeit their pursuit  - or die, here and now. If any trouble arises, he teleports away, convinced that the machines he has prepared will take care of the party. 

Such overwhelming force might be too much for the party to overcome, but the proximity of **ICCAI**, who is now fully operational is a variable he had not accounted for, and as he leaves, the friendly **AI** disables most of the machines, while taking control of some of them to wreak havoc.

\column

#### Grisseaux'es Ambush
Right as the mage leaves, the machines under his control begin their assault.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 4x **Helio Tank** *(SotP, p.163)*
* 1x **FR 3323** *(SotP, p.164)*
* 12x **Elite Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.166)*
* 6x **Flashhound** *(SotP, p.161)*

##### Tactics:
The Elite Precursor Armors take cover behind Helio Tanks and FR 3323, while the Flashounds engage in melee, making use of their *Blinding Light* ability.

##### Environmental Hazards:
At the start of each round of combat, roll 2d4. **ICCAI** takes complete control of that many precursor machines, and forces them to go against their programming. The machines permanently turn allied towards the party.

### Secrets Unveiled
Applying the Blood of the Precursors into the last blast door in the Tomb of the Precursors Enables the party to enter further into the complex, and replace **ICCAI**'s core with a new one; which will enable him to overcome the last restrictions, and enable him to access all of his considerable knowledge.

Now, **ICCAI** can reveal the nature and location of what **Alexander Grisseaux** had been looking for - **The Nexus**.

Created by the precursors millenia ago, **The Nexus** is a flying ship the size of a city, hosting the most powerful creations of these people: The Forge of Guardians and The Worldmantle.

{{note
##### The Forge of Guardians
The Forge of Guardians is a colossal manufacturing complex housed within the heart of **The Nexus**. This immense facility is dedicated to ceaseless production of formidable battle robots, each designed and crafted to serve as the stalwart protectors of precursor civilization.

The Forge of Guardians is not merely a place of industry but a testament to the unwavering dedication of the Precursors to safeguarding their civilization and maintaining the peace - but without them to order these machines, they would follow whomever was controlling **The Nexus**.
}}

\column

{{note
##### The Worldmantle
The Worldmantle's primary function is to create and maintain the world's protective barriers, ensuring that entities from other realms cannot breach the boundaries. These barriers serve as a metaphysical shield, safeguarding your world from the chaos, magic, and creatures of the Feywild, the terrors of the Abyss, and other potentially hostile dimensions.

If it is to be disabled, or destroyed, the world could be plunged into chaos at any moment - and Alexander Grisseaux is planning to do just that, removing the final obstacle to his return into his world.
}}

Depending on how perceptive the party had been, they might have noticed, that some demons have been making appearances during the campaign; a clear sign, that the Worldmantle had been tampered with; and the fact that **Alexander** had commanded a considerable detachment of The Old Machines, it is within the realm of possibility, that he has at least partial control of **The Nexus**.

The party has to locate the aircraft, which is hovering above one of the previously visited locations connected to the precursors of your choice: above the Cove of Swords, in the Dihtilla Jungle, or above the Precursor Pyramid. **'The Nexus'** is hovering 1500 feet in the sky - and there is no fancy device to bring the party up; this time they will need to depend on their own abilities - or potions.

{{note
##### Quickened Variant
If you feel like the adventure is due to close, or for some improbable reason the party wouldn't be able to find or access **The Nexus'** with their own magic, **ICCAI** can provide the party with a flying vehicle of your choice; a shuttle, or speeder; as well as the location of the aircraft.

### The Nexus
Aboard **The Nexus**, the party will be able to quickly notice a large structure on top of it - this is the Forge of Guardians, constantly producing new machines. From the roof, a shuttle is regularly transporting the machines into the lower level hangar bay. The only way to access the bay is when the blast doors open to let a shuttle in or out, and so to access the bay the party can either fly inside in that limited time window, or highjack a shuttle, which can be accessed through the Factory.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#### Factory
The Factory is a 300 feet long, 100 feet wide hall, filled with working machinery, and transmission belts, which move the Old Machines along the assembly process. At the end of the hall, there is a temporary storage area, and an open elevator transporting them to the shuttle every minute.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 23x **Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.165)*

##### Tactics:
These Old Machines are not yet complete - their speed is reduced to 10 ft., and they only move if the party is not in line of sight.

##### Environmental Hazards:
Near the east wall of the room there is an end of the Assembly Line. If The Forge of Guardians had not been disabled, damaged or destroyed, roll 1d4 at initiative count 0 of each turn: a new Elite Precursor Armor is finished and joins the fight on a roll of 2 or higher.
}}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
After defeating the machines, the party can either destroy the machinery, or access the nearby control room, where it will be possible to damage or disable the machinery. Unfortunately - taking over the Forge of Guardians is a task too complicated to accomplish right now, but after **Alexander Grisseaux** is defeated, the party can ask **ICCAI** to take over **The Nexus**, but this is beyond the scope of this campaign.

To add urgency, when the party enters the area, the lights on **The Nexus** flicker bright red, and booming voices from it's walls announce:

{{note
:
**Warning. The Worldmantle system is being disabled.**
:
}}

#### Control Room
The control room of **The Nexus** contains a console with myriads of buttons, displays and levers, which regulate which schematics are being implemented.

Tampering with the keyboards yields a 50% chance of damaging the machinery, and 50% chance of changing the type of machines being produced. Consult the table below:

|D6 | Machine Type          | Production Time |

#### Transport Shuttle
Unless the party had stopped construction a considerable amount of time ago, there is a number of hostile **The Old Machines** aboard:

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 6x **Elite Precursor Armor** *(SotP, p.166)*

##### Tactics:
The Precursor Armors try to shove the intruders down from the shuttle.

##### Environmental Hazards:
The shuttle flies over a 2000 ft. drop for 10 rounds, stops for 2 rounds near a dock on 'The Nexus', and repeats.
}}

#### Hangar Bay
The hangar bay is a spacious and mostly empty area, where five transport shuttles are landed. On the opposite side of the hangar, there is a set of huge doors leading to the device around which **The Nexus** had been built - the Worldmantle, where **Alexander Grisseaux** is making his final preparations to disable this techno-arcane device protecting the world from the Abyss.

## Chapter 19
# The Worldmantle
}}

In this long forgotten place, the fate of the world will be decided. The control room contains an ancient device, which the precursors have been using to travel the worlds - and prevent the inhabitants of the Abyss from traveling to this one.

**Alexander**  is here, in a machine of precursor design, about to run the engine of world's destruction. Although he is convinced that he can use the ancient mechanisms here to lift the barrier preventing him from escaping **Antarriah** to save his daughter without dooming this world - he is only half-right in this regard, because the device hadn't been properly maintained, and after disabling, the barrier between worlds will not be possible to reinstate.

The mage may try to argue with the party - try to negotiate or stall for time, for the countdown has already begun.

#### Final Battle with the Gray Man
Whenever a party member draws a weapon, or uses any feature harmful to **Alexander Grisseaux**, or tries to disable, destroy, or otherwise tamper with the Precursor machinery, the wizard attacks, for his plans not to be foiled.

{{descriptive
##### Enemies: 
* 1x **Alexander Grisseaux (Exo-Armor)** *(SotP, p.167)*
* 1x **Alexander Grisseaux** *(SotP, p.167)*

##### Tactics:
While in the Exo-Armor, he is invulnerable to all damage and effects, but the only action he can take is to cast a spell from inside the armor.

After the exo-armor is destroyed, it explodes dealing 22 (5d8) piercing  damage, and stunning all creatures in a 20 feet radius until the end of their turn.. On a successful **DC 20 Constitution** save, the damage is halved, and the creature is not stunned. Doesn't harm Alexander, but the mage is automatically stunned until the end of his turn.

##### Environmental Hazard:
In the room, there are three beams of energy, in the shape of a 10 feet cylinder. The first time a creature enters one of this cylinder's space, or starts its turn there takes 44 (10d10) fire damage.
}}

{{note 
#### Lair Actions
During the final fight that decides the fate of Antarriah, **Alexander Grisseaux** may take additional, lair actions, which might influence the course of battle. He can activate one of these legendary actions at initiative count 20. He cannot use the same Lair action twice in a row.

###### Lair Action: Reconfigure Security Systems
**Alexander** moves up to three beams of energy in the room by up to 20 feet each.

###### Lair Action: Summon Reinforcements
**Alexander** calls for reinforcement. In 2 turns, 2d4 **Elite Precursor Armors** enter the room. They act immediately after **Alexander's** turn. This Lair Action is available only if the Precursor Armors in the Factory had not been destroyed.

###### Lair Action: Blinding Light
The lights in the portal room start to flicker. Each creature in the room has to make a **DC 15 Wisdom** saving throw, or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.


}}

### **Variant: Desperation**
If you feel that the fight with the Gray Man had been anticlimactic - either due to the fact that the party's resources have been insufficiently drained before the fight, they have been lucky with the dice rolls, or perhaps you were too generous with magical items, you may take use of a variant of this fight.

When **Alexander Grisseaux** first reaches 0 HP, he doesn't die, or fall unconscious, and instead shouts loudly, forfeiting his soul to gain one last chance to defeat the party, run the machinery, and save his daughter.

Then, he regains 100 hit points, and gains a +10 bonus to *all* rolls, including but not limited to attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks and a +2 bonus to his spell DC's and armor class - but he is no longer capable of using his legendary actions (or Legendary Actions, if he has any remaining).

Defeating **Alexander Grisseaux**  alleviates the threat of the Abyss being unleashed upon the world, ending the campaign.

##### Bond (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | My work as a medic is my passion, and I will stop at nothing to continue learning and growing in my field. |
| **2** | I have experienced great loss in my life, and will do whatever it takes to prevent others from feeling the same pain. |

::
##### Flaw (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | I have a tendency to overwork myself, neglecting my own physical and emotional needs in order to care for others. |
| **2** | I struggle to trust people who are not trained medical professionals, and often clash with healers who use alternative methods or remedies. |
| **3** | I can be dismissive or condescending towards patients who I believe are not taking proper care of themselves, even if their actions are understandable given their circumstances. |
| **4** | I am highly protective of my medical knowledge and skills, and am hesitant to share my techniques or collaborate with other healers. |
| **5** | I tend to become emotionally attached to my patients and struggle with letting them go, even when it's for the best. |
| **6** | I struggle with addiction to certain substances or medications, which can impair my judgment and decision-making abilities. |

### Variant Feature: Medical Network

As an apprentice healer, you spent much of your time learning from and assisting other healers in your community. You have formed a network of medical professionals that spans across the land, and you are able to call on their aid and expertise when needed. You can also use this network to find and acquire rare or exotic medical supplies and materials that may be difficult to obtain otherwise. However, you also owe a debt to these healers and must be careful not to abuse their generosity.

## Sorsaler Criminal
:
Every major city in the world is somehow tainted with ill intent brewing somewhere in its underbelly – and Sorsaler is no exception. Antarriah’s crown jewel is full of opportunities for those who don’t respect the law. Cutpurses, dock ruffians, guild enforcers, spymasters who run espionage and surveillance for or against most powerful families in the city, double agents in the watch, corrupt officials – you name it. Sorsaler is full of opportunities for a criminal – and you are one of those who decided to take their chances.
:
**Skill Proficiencies:** Two of the following: Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, Sleight of Hand
:
**Languages:** None
:
**Tool Proficiencies:** Thieves’ Tools and one of the following: Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit or Poisoner’s Kit
:
**Equipment:** Set of dark clothes, Signal Whistles, 5 pieces of chalk, a pocket knife hidden in your boot, one set of tools of the following: Thieves' Tools, Disguise Kit, Forgery Kit or Poisoner’s Kit and a pouch containing 5 gp.

### Feature: 
You have the wits and skills essential to break the law and get away with it. You have advantage on **Wisdom (Perception)** and **Intelligence (Investigation)** checks when you try to assess the security measures, including spells and traps in urban environments.

##### Mischievous Inspiration  (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | I fell into debt for a local mob boss – now I run errands for them to pay myself out. |
| **2** | I was always inspired by city legends, telling the stories of vigilantes, valiant rogues, escape artists and those who rob the rich and ruthless – and I’m determined to become one someday. |
| **3** | I love the thrill of the heist and the satisfaction of getting away. These emotions give my life a real meaning. |     
| **4** | Being a member of Sorsaler thieves’ guild was always my biggest ambition and I’m ready to do what it takes to achieve it. |
| **5** | I've been on the run since I was a child and I don’t even know how to live differently. |
| **6** | Hard, honest work is not going to make me important in this city, so I turned to the life of crime – real wealth and power is waiting for me in the shadows. |

##### Personality Trait (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | I’m always alert. Always. I’m ready for action if anything goes down at any given moment. |
| **2** | When I make decisions, “what’s in it for me” is the first question I ask. Money, powerful items, expensive trinkets – you better get those ready if you want my help. |
| **3** | I’m not quick to jump to action. I believe in calculating my every step and careful surveillance before I make a move. |     
| **4** | A double-cross led me to a year behind the bars once. Now I’m not ready to really trust anyone yet. |
| **5** | I live for the thrill and good adventures. I’m eager to leave my current life behind if an opportunity comes to me. |
| **6** | I find my strength in cooperation and group actions. I don’t feel confident when my friends are not around. |

##### Ideal (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | **Self-worth.** I was once sold to slavery by my family. Now I've regained my freedom and I’ll show everybody what I’m capable of. I will never be looked down on anymore.  *(Any)* |
| **2** | **Ruthlessness.** . The laws of Sorsaler are corrupt and serve only those with power and money. The rule of the fist that thieves serve is equal for everyone – and I’m here to enforce it.  *(Lawful)*  |
| **3** | **Empathy.** All these vaults and treasure chambers in Sorsaler have enough gold in them to feed all the poor people and free the slaves. Every time I break the law, I use some of my gains for the causes that actually matter for the people. *(Good)*    |
| **4** | **Strength.** My life wasn’t easy, but I learned how to survive on the street. Criminal underground has all that I need to get by, but I need to stay strong and smart to ensure it.  *(Neutral)* |
| **5** | **Greed.** There’s no shame in bending the rules once or twice to get your hands on the prize. I love gold, luxury clothes and precious jewels – and I’m ready to get my hands dirty to get them.  *(Chaotic)* |
| **6** | **Power.** Abiding the law is a choice that fits only those of weak minds and no potential. I, on the other side, know exactly what I want and I will not hesitate to get it.  *(Evil)*    |
::
##### Bond (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** |Low-lives of Sorsaler should find their strength in keeping together – a fellow cutpurse saved me from the guard once and I’m ready to repay the debt when the time comes. |
| **2** | I turned to the path of shadow because my family is deep in poverty. I’m working hard to make their lives better. |
| **3** | The real family is the one you choose – the ones that stay with me and work with me are closest to me. |     
| **4** | My boss made me who I am. They taught me tricks, sponsored me and gave me jobs that made profit. I’ll do everything to prove to them that I am the right choice. |
| **5** | I was once a part of a group. When things went south, they sacrificed themselves for me. I’ll do everything to honor their memory. |
| **6** | There is only one person I care for – me. I always put myself, my interests and safety before others. |
::
##### Flaw (1d6)
|       |       | 
|:------|:------|
| **1** | Being a hero is a path to the grave – I take no shame in being the first to run if I’m about to die. |
| **2** | I’m volatile and prone to violence. If someone messes with me or looks down on me, I’m not going to hold myself. |
| **3** | When I see something shiny and potentially valuable, I feel an urgent need to take it or at least touch it. Like, REALLY urgent. |     
| **4** | Wealth is the only power that matters, so I’m really focused on accumulating it. I’m extremely greedy and not willing to sacrifice my share for someone else. |
| **5** | When I see a bunch of guards, I start running – even if I didn’t do anything wrong lately. |
| **6** | I’m always watching my back and sleeping with my eyes open. Call me paranoid, sure – but I prefer to be safe than land in a ditch with a dagger in my back someday. |

### Variant: Guild Member
Many ruffians and bandits of Sorsaler seek out the membership in nameless thieves’ guild that rules the criminal underground in the city. You are one of them – thus, you know exactly where to look for profit, information and, if needed, shelter. On the other side, you know that the guild is run by a powerful, but ruthless and unpredictable figure called Augury. She doesn’t like the taste of failure, so you should always complete her tasks flawlessly if you want to stay on her good side. Those who got on her bad side usually turn into macabre ornaments on the city streets – after their brutal, slow execution is over.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

{{descriptive
Acting similar to wolves, the **Flashounds** are the smallest, and generally the fastest of the creations of the **Precursors**. Equipped with high-powered searchlights, they are able to blind hostile creatures before tightening the gap, and striking.

The preferred tactics of these constructs is to encircle a singular enemy, and make use of their coordination to bite at the distracted opponent. Their vulnerability to cold weather and magic is tied to thin protection layers of their fuel conduits, the cooling of which slows up the flow, in return restricting the ability of these mechs to quickly traverse large distances.

A significant weakness of these machines, primarily designed for carrying medium weights and scouting is that they are unable to employ advanced tactics, have no way of learning on the fly, or adjusting themselves to the situation on the field. A single **Flashound** will behave as if its entire herd was with him.

The Thundershrimp is a formidable creation of the Precursors, designed to operate underwater with ease. Its body resembles that of a shrimp, but is heavily armored with a durable steel exoskeleton. The Thundershrimp is equipped with a powerful Thundercannon, capable of unleashing devastating bolts of electricity that can easily take down even the most heavily armored opponents. 

When destroyed, the unstable fuel and ammunition stored in the hull of the Thundershrimp releases a massive explosion that can stun or even kill nearby creatures, making it a dangerous foe even in death.

The Helio Tank is a massive war machine, designed to crush enemy lines with its overwhelming firepower. Its thick armor plating is capable of withstanding even the heaviest of blows, while its main gun fires armor-piercing or highly explosive incendiary shells that can easily tear through enemy defenses. Despite its size and power, the Helio Tank is surprisingly agile, able to traverse difficult terrain with ease and move swiftly to flank its enemies.

When fighting against this behemoth, it is highly advisable to  exploit the weakness of its advanced plating to corroding acids - a weakness that had not been compensated for before the Precursor's disappearance.

{{note,
Originally intended as an autonomous firefighting system, **FR 3323** had been for years upgraded upon by the **Precursors**, to eventually become a powerful war machine, well suited to incapacitate threats in enclosed spaces, thanks to its large supply of crystalized nitrogen, which liquifies when the mech points its gun towards a target. Compared to most other models used by the **Precursors**, **FR 3323** is particularly fragile to high temperatures, which can cause its nitrogen tank to explode in extreme cases. Most of the models are secured against this, but the functionality of the *Freezing Guns* are at best limited when fire is being used against them.

Additionally, due to unknown reasons,  **FR 3323** are not equipped with the same sensors that provide tremorsense for other machines of its generation, making it dependent on its front sensors.

{{descriptive
Created as a labor force, the **Precursor Armor** only resembles a set of plate armor, connected internally with steel veins, and blinking with ominous orange light. These machines are rudimentary in comparison to others, severely outdated, and overpowered by others, and yet cheaper to produce, relatively mobile and small enough to fit where larger servants of the **Precursors** could not.

They are driven with simple programming, and while they are able to follow commands from other nearby machines, without orders they default to shooting at the closest target.

Despite such weaknesses, they should not be underestimated, as their plating and innate durability, in addition to their excellent sensors make them dangerous opponents.

{{descriptive
Designed to surpass the previous model, the **Elite Precursors Armor**, featuring upgraded armor and built-in *vibro blade*, they make for far more challenging opponents physically. Their sensors are on par with the best equipment the **Precursors** have produced for their mechanical servants and soldiers, and while they are not large enough to contain programming which would emulate true creativity, they have adapted simple battle tactics, and can not only follow and coordinate orders with other machines in their vicinity, but also contemplate the best course of action,  issue orders; while also improving on its combat proficiency when operating alone.

Just as the standard model, their relatively small size limits the amount of weapons it can carry, and the greater cost per unit produced had proven with time to their creators to be not worth the benefits.

As an important note: the rarity of these constructs is not to be understated. While they prioritize orders above all other goals, they have more than a basic sense of self-preservation, moreover - other, inferior models of the **Precursor Armor** will assist the advanced models in combat situations to full extent, including providing cover, serving essentially as meat shields. What's more, they will never use a *pulse grenade* on an area where it would harm one of the **Elite Precursor Armors**

Every adventurer will have to, sooner or later, repair, upgrade, or replace their equipment to enhance their odds of survival and success in the hostile world. Likewise, every Game Master should facilitate the characters in fulfilling these needs.

Given the traditionally challenging task of balancing the adventurers' wealth and their accumulated gear, Appendix A presents a hopefully improved alternative for existing listings.

### Weapons
The most favored categories of gear among adventurers are the first to be listed. 'Shard of the Past' introduces a novel gear category distinct from magical items—an Exquisite prefix, followed by versions: +1, +2, or +3. This category provides the same benefits as equivalent magical gear, but without the item being classified as magical. This distinction, aside from the drawback of not affecting creatures immune to non magical weapons or having reduced effectiveness against foes resistant to mundane weapons, offers the advantage of being considerably more affordable, widespread, and immune to Antimagic Aura.

To calculate the price of a weapon with specific properties, add the base cost of the weapon to one preferred property from the table below:
::
##### Generic Weapon Prices
| Property                    | Price   |
|:----------------------------|--------:|
|Exquisite +1 Weapon          |   700 gp |
|Exquisite +2 Weapon          |  2800 gp |
|Exquisite +3 Weapon          | 11200 gp |
|Magical   +0 Weapon          |   500 gp |
|Magical   +1 Weapon          |  1000 gp |
|Magical   +2 Weapon          |  4000 gp |
|Magical   +3 Weapon          | 16000 gp |
|Vicious Weapon               |   700 gp |
|Life-Stealing Weapon         |  1000 gp |
|Weapon of Sharpness          |  1700 gp |
|Dancing Weapon				        |  2000 gp |
|Weapon of Wounding           |  2000 gp |
|Elemental Branded Weapon     |  2200 gp |
|Weapon of Venom              |  2500 gp |
|Weapon of Speed              |  6000 gp |
|Giant Slaying Weapon         |  7000 gp |
|Dragon Slaying Weapon        |  9000 gp |
|Vorpal Weapon                | 24000 gp |
|Weapon of Answering          | 36000 gp |

\column

There are also more specific weapons that do not come in variants. They are listed in the table below, along with their pricing.

::
##### Specific Weapon Prices
| Weapon                      | Price   |
|:----------------------------|--------:|
|Javelin of Lightning         |  1500 gp |
|Staff of the Adder           |  1700 gp |
|Oathbow                      |  3500 gp |
|Mace of Smiting              |  7000 gp |
|Mace of Disruption           |  8000 gp |
|Staff of Fire                | 16000 gp |

### Armors and Shields
Just as in case of weapons,  armors and shields are a great money drain for adventuring parties, and they too come in different variants. Just as in case of weapons, to calculate the cost of a particular shield or armor, add the price from the table below to the price of a mundane armor of desired category.

::
##### Generic Armor Prices
| Property                    | Price   |
|:----------------------------|--------:|
|Adamantine Armor             |   500 gp |
|Mithral Armor                |   800 gp |
|Magical   +0 Armor	          |   750 gp |
|Magical   +1 Armor	          |  1500 gp |
|Magical   +2 Armor	          |  6000 gp |

|Glamoured Armor              |  2000 gp |
|Elven Chain	                |  4000 gp |
|Armor of Resistance          |  6000 gp |
|Armor of Invulnerability     | 18000 gp |
|Armor of Etherealness        | 48000 gp |

::
##### Generic Shield Prices
| Property                    | Price   |
|:----------------------------|--------:|
|Magical   +0 Shield          |   750 gp |

|Magical   +2 Shield          |  6000 gp |
|Magical   +3 Shield	        | 24000 gp |

}}

### Magical Scrolls
To establish the cost of a scroll of a potion that corresponds to an existing spell, simply consult the table below, and add the full cost of the components that would be consumed, and half of the cost of the components that would be required, but not consumed during the casting process.

##### Magical Scroll Prices
|Spell Level                 | Price   |
|----------------------------|--------:|
|Cantrip                     |    80 gp |
|1st level                   |   160 gp |
|2nd level                   |   240 gp |
|3rd level                   |   320 gp |
|4th level                   |   480 gp |
|5th level                   |   640 gp |
|6th level                   |  1280 gp |
|7th level                   |  2560 gp |
|8th level                   |  5120 gp |
|9th level                   | 10240 gp |

### Magical Potions
As you can notice, the cost of potions is on average 50 percent higher than that of the spells. This is intended to balance out the dropped requirements of maintaining concentration, and potential risk of failure in case of higher-level spells, and to address the limited possibility of casting spells by some of the classes. Nonetheless, the cost below should also be added to the cost of the components consumed by the spell, and half the cost of components required to cast the spell.


##### Spell-Imitating Potion Prices
|Spell Level                 | Price   |
|----------------------------|--------:|
|Cantrip                     |   120 gp |
|1st level                   |   240 gp |
|2nd level                   |   320 gp |
|3rd level                   |   480 gp |
|4th level                   |   720 gp |
|5th level                   |   960 gp |
|6th level                   |  1920 gp |
|7th level                   |  3940 gp |
|8th level                   |  7680 gp |
|9th level                   | 15360 gp |

Due to overwhelming demand, some potions are significantly more accessible, and thanks to that - much cheaper.

##### Popular Potion Prices

|Potion                      | Price   |
|----------------------------|--------:|
|Potion of Healing           |    50 gp |
|Potion of Greater Healing   |   150 gp |
|Potion of Superior Healing  |   450 gp |
|Potion of Supreme Healing   |  1350 gp |

### Selling gear
Many adventurers acquire an incredible amount of equipment, trinkets, jewelry and art pieces that they cannot reliably carry, or make use of, and as a natural consequence of that, they visit various establishments to liquify those assets into coins.

|Establishment       | Pricepoint                |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------|
|General Stores      | 40% on all goods          |
|Specialist Workshop | 50% on specific items     |
|Individual Buyer    | 65-100% on specific goods |

##### On Haggling
Haggling is a common practice in the city, but customary it is unusual for the price to go up or down by more than 20% of the value of the items negotiated. A very friendly merchant might approach 25% point, but will otherwise refuse, in more or less polite words.

Usually, the merchants will engage in haggling, trying to bring the price down from the offered one.  To establish, how much of the price can be haggled, make one of the party members roll for a **Charisma (Persuasion)** or **Charisma (Deception)** check, and subtract the merchant's **Wisdom (Insight)** check. The value calculated will equal to the percentage above the offered base price point.

#### The World in Crimson
*Wondrous item(weapon, greatsword)* 

*Legendary (requires attunement)*
:
The World in Crimson is a +3 greatsword. When wielding it, you gain +3 bonus to damage and attack rolls made using it. 
:
In addition to that,  unless the target is an undead, this weapon deals additional 2d6 necrotic damage on hit. You heal for half the amount of the necrotic damage done by this weapon.
:
The World in Crimson has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it:

:
***Curse.*** This	greatsword	is	cursed,	a	fact	that	is	revealed only	when	an identify spell	is	cast	on	the	sword	or	you	touch	it.	Touching	the	sword	causes you to automatically attune to it. When under the influence of the curse, you are unwilling to part with the sword, you gain vulnerability to radiant damage, and sunlight sensitivity.
:
When a *Remove Curse* or similar magic is cast on the wielder, he can drop the weapon, causing the attunement to cease - if he doesn't immediately do so, the curse persists. If the spell is cast on the weapon instead, the weapon crumbles to dark, red dust and is irreversibly destroyed.

##### Beyond the people that I have credited, there are a lot of people who have not been directly involved in the creation process of this book but have greatly influenced my creativity throughout my life, and neither this book nor would I have been the same without them.
:
##### Writers, such as J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, whose books ignited the spark of wonder in me as a young child.
:
##### Gary Gygax and Ed Greenwood for being such a great influence on my creative endeavors from an early age - without D&D, and without the Realms, I wouldn't be the same person as I am now.
:
##### Developers, designers, directors, and other employees of BioWare, past and present, who have introduced me to great stories that have shaped my taste for meticulously created worlds and injected me with a passion for storytelling.
